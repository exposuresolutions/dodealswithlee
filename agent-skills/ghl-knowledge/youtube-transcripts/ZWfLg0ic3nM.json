  "transcript": "So today we're going to create an ivr system for our company using high levels ivr connection that they've enabled for anybody that has text messaging services in their High LEL count so stay tuned and build along with us for anybody that doesn't understand what an ivr system is common example is if you call like let's say a big company and let's say like you're calling your bank or whatever else the second you dial your number it says thank you for calling whatever Bank please press one for sales press two for customer service press three for this and based on what you press it either connects you to the person or better yet it gives you a choice for another menu item that can lead to different choices and even some self-help sometimes well ivr is exactly that and what high level's done is they basically have given you this additional ability to do that through automations at no additional cost so what we're going to do today is build one and actually show you that the recipe that high level has already for us that is we're just going to build upon and customize it the way we want it to ensure we have the best kind of overall delivery of our brand new ivr system and now we're actually doing this live for our own CRM so if anybody ever dial in we can get them into the right direction so we can get them the help that they need or better yet if it's a sale that they're interested in get them the support that they require so the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to go into our account and we're going to go right from the left-and side we're going to go first to check out settings and then go to phones the one thing that you definitely going to need is you're going to need an active number that you're going to be able to leverage in order for this to work so the one thing you're definitely going to need is an active number and you're going to have to make sure that you have a number that's already been a2p verified and it's ready to roll so we already have one we're going to use this one to be the ivr because this is the main number that we have associated with this account and it's going to be the same number we're going to use for the ivr and if you want to kind of get another number where you just want to have that one specifically for that you can go ahead and do so too but for instance we're going to leverage this one and what we're going to do is we're going to go back to our ivr system and we're going to start creating it now I'm going to go to automations on the left- hand side and basically my automations what I'm going to do is I'm going to go all the way down and I created a folder called ivr because I want to make sure that anything related to the ivr I do it separately so then I can go back and I can make whatever I need to first thing I'm going to do is create a workflow by hitting the blue button and what I am going to use is like high levels been incredibly gracious in the fact that they give you a recipe that you can leverage for your ivr program now so I'm going to go ahead and hit select and I'm going to work off of this one because honestly it's going to cut a lot of time in order for you to do this so first and foremost I'm going to go over here and it goes to start ivr trigger in here there's a phone number and I'm going to select the phone number that is relative into this account I recommend just doing one ivr system per number if you're going to use a different number then go ahead and use a different number but then I would do a separate automation again you could have a where it's coming off of both numbers completely up to you but I just like to separate things if you guys know kind of the way I work the first thing is the welcome message that the caller is going to hear so here it's hey welcome to Rapid active all right it's going to be a woman's voice that's perfectly fine you could do a man or a woman but I'm going to do a woman instead number Loops is how many times should the message be repeated by default this is always set to one we're going to leave that to one now notice that the first message I can either play a message or say a message meaning if I want to play a message it's a pre-recorded message if I want to say a message it's going to use the woman voice to say the message that I put in here so whatever I write is what they're going to say I would just recommend don't go too long and just make sure you're spelling everything out like for instance CRM I'm probably going to remove because it's going to go Crim instead of CR RM unless I do c space r space again M and if I do that then it'll read the letters congruently versus you know kind of trying to spell out whatever it is so be very very careful if you have an odd company name you can always play the message that you re-record versus doing the writing message on here so I'm going to go ahead and save action hey we want to interrupt this video for a quick little minute to just let you know that I hope you're enjoying this video we want to thank you for being here but more importantly we're hoping that this content helps you do whatever you're trying to do

quick little minute but more importantly go back to the video get whatever you need and if you have any questions that we can answer inside the video just drop a comment on the video and we'll make sure to answer whenever we get a chance and now back to the show now right here is next step that we're going to do again we're using this one just to kind of get you up and running faster is collect input from caller right and we're going to do is say a message so the message is going to read press one to hear our list of services press two to leave a voicemail press three to talk to our team so we're going to change this up a bit so one it's going to be press one for customer service press two for technical support press three to leave a voicemail for Nuno press four to leave a voicemail for Andy all right we'll make it super easy again we're going to have English we're going to have a woman and then we're going to have the number of Loops again being one but pretty simple right we use commas just like they have it right here and I'm going to go ahead and hit save and we got to make sure that we have four now whatever they respond back if they press one we want to make sure that they go to the right place press one remember this is the branch this is going to be for customer support okay press two is going to be for technical support press three is going to be for Nuno voicemail all right and press for we have to add a branch because it's not in here right so I added another branch and then I have press for to leave Andy a voicemail and then what we got to do is because we don't have that set up but we need the input in the ivr what I'm going to do is I'm going to hit select and when I hit select you're going to see ivr gather and then collect input from the digits that are being dialed notice that it's the only drop down so the second I collect input they only have digits I select is and it's going to be four all right and then I'm going to go ahead and hit save now as you can see it's got different things that are going to happen right now if they select press one for customer support I can do another list that says here's a list of services created by our business service one service two so let's kind of add to that it's unavoidable to create spidering in this one so just understand that when you get to these different choices you might have to like kind of Branch out things even more so just understand that this is kind of the way it's just going to be for this one press one and make sure you're using the number one not the letter like not the lettering L it's just press one for billing press two for anything else all right because I don't want to go super long again it's going to be everything else make sure you spell right this is where my dyslexia unfortunately is not going to be a good thing because if I misspell anything here that's exactly what it's going to show afterwards all right now if they have a list of services and they're pressing I have to finish each branch at a time cuz now I have to then go from our if else because now based on what they respond right so and just to give you an idea we're doing exactly this map callers input and then we're going to go from there but it is a condition so I'm going to come over here and it's going to be if else and we're going to label it customer support support choices again just to make it super easy and then the first branch is going to be billing if they press one so again come in here ivr gather collect one digit is one all right how cool is that and then you put it in there the second one is anything else so we're just going to hit add Branch anything else or I should say everything else everything else now I got to go back and change it see this is again where misspelling will not be your friend if you mess this up because it is going to say exactly what you write is to all right I'm going to go ahead and hit save and I'm going to come over here use a little hand just drag it back and forth go back to list of services for everything else see I got to change is for everything else okay and then if I come in here now I have a choice if I click on the plus sign right there's a couple things we can do here one I can send a voicemail message back two I can transfer to our customer support line which is our operations manager or three I can send a text message back however you want to do it but if you scroll down by hitting the little plus sign right let me just do that again I'm going to go all the way down and just start over oh even let me do it click on here we are looking for or slay Place message connect a call or record a v mail or end call right what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and connect a call and I would select a user whoever this might be again none of them have assigned number so I'm just going to pretend I'm going to pick this number here this user here this is going to be grayed out obviously or you can add a custom number so for instance if I just legit wanted to just dial my cell phone I come in here and I can dial my cell phone it goes directly into the cell phone right and that's connect called call it's going to immediately try to connect the call I can try to connect the call but what I'm also going to do as a fail safe is I'm going to come over here to the choices do internal send internal notification select the user or like again just for instance it's going to be SMS I can select the particular user that I wanted to send to because this is going to be very specific so I would just pick a name doesn't matter which one it is you have a request from the ivr for this number please call back right away Boom come in here contact phone because that's what you would have because sometimes you might not have their name and you go in there but maybe for everything else you just want them to record a message so the first thing I'm going to say is please leave a message for Mary whatever you know what I'm saying and just make it super simple so I'm going to go all the way down to the voice again I'm going to say say play message and hello you just say please leave a message for Mary here okay going to hit save action all right and then I'm going to allow it to record a voicemail action name record voicemail and this is going to be for everything else support stop recording on key press you know some people do pound I think that's like the general one so I'm just going to put pound ask voice instructions if you want you know you can I'm not going to do that I mean most people know how to record a message and then I'm going to hit save and then honestly it says where can I find the recording recordings can be accessed in conversations meaning in the conversations this is where this recording is going to be placed right and then I'm going to come over here and just for none just for the sake of having always a fail safe I'm going to copy it here now you see two different ways one connects to the person sends an internal notification just to ensure that the person picks up the second one plays a message and then leaves a recording and same thing with everything else with the other one just in case we do the none just in case it doesn't happen now if they press two for technical support record the message from the caller please record your message once you've recorded the message press the pound symbol to make it complete fantastic I should have used those instructions down here which I can literally do that and it records the message for whatever we're going to say 3,600 seconds and then same thing to leave a voicemail for Nuno I can either transfer to my line just like you see here but I'm going to delete it and honestly I'm actually just going to copy these two things record the message from the caller for both here so I'm going to copy all actions boom copy all actions here and then please record your message because I've already said the person name please record your message for Nuno Boom come over here just change it up a little bit again this is all the stuff that they gave me already for Andy boom boom boom now it takes care of Andy and then goes when no condition is matched play this message you haven't entered a valid input please listen to the options again and make a valid selection and then all it's going to do is the same messaging in here when no conditions or match because I didn't like these I'm going to delete this actually because guess what it's going to do I'm going to come over here or actually go back to the welcome message copy all actions from here boom look at this how crazy is that and then I have a full-fledged ivr system ladies and gentlemen how easy is this now when somebody dials that number and you can put it on your websites and everything else you have a fully like ivr message system that you can now mind you on top of recorded messages I can also send a quick little text message right so I can come in here and say hey I received your message and will be with you shortly all right and there's other kind of caveats and cool things you can do but this definitely opens it up but if you want a simple thing that comes already with your voicemail options inside of here you can easily like make this up and have it ready to go and it took us all about 10 minutes and you have a full ivr system ladies and gentlemen for some people this costs like thousands of dollars a month and you're getting it included in your highle package and as long as you have a text message number that you can attach to this you have the ability of building one of these for yourselves and for your clients so hopefully this helps and we'll see you in the next one [Music]",
