  "transcript": "High Level just released massive amounts of updates to Voice AI, including a voice AI widget that you can add to your website. And today, not only are we going to go over all the new AI voice [music] features that is going to be able to help you make a better bot, but more importantly, we're going to add the widget to a website to see how it works. So stay tuned and build along with us. So if you wanted to watch like we did a previous video, actually we did several videos on Voice AI. So you might want to check those out before coming to this video because those are going to show you how to create the prompt, how to create workflows, and everything else and go over a full workrough. Today's video is mostly going to be about a lot of the updates to show you the things that have changed just to give you a little bit of a better refresh of understanding how the new system is going to work. Now, a lot of these features are now only in labs, but by the time this video rolls out, they'll probably be fully updated. So, let's go ahead and jump right to it. So, the first thing I want to do is I'm going to go over my agency settings. And just like before with any AI updates, you're going to want to make sure that these are on. You're going to go over to settings. Inside of settings, you're going to go over to labs. And in labs, you're going to go ahead and you're going to just check out all the different things that are here. Right now, we've turned a couple of these on, but a lot of these are not voice AI related. So, what we're going to do is we're just going to double check, make sure nothing comes out because obviously they're releasing features every day. And what we're going to do is we're going to go to the sub account level. In the sub account level, you're going to go to voice AI. There's a couple here. There's the voice AI tokenbased usage. This is now changing the way they've upgraded the way the agents are built. Apparently, this is going to be much more favorable for us. It's all going to be live in 5 days anyway. So, by the time you watch this video, we're all going to be on it. We have voice support and conversational AI. Enable voice conversation to respond to voice messages. Bring your conversation select based on that. So, these are all new features are going to have. And then you're going to have voice AI outbound calling. This is all still going to be live in 4 days. We are going to have a special one for that because it does require a little bit of knowhow and a little bit of knowledge. And I definitely want to go over the laws and rules about that because that is going to be separate on its own. Voice AI MCP support. There's a whole section in the vibe coding section of the channel that kind of goes over connecting MCPs, how to do it, and so forth. But then we're going to also show you how to do it, but that's going to come a little bit later because I believe that we have now 21 endpoints. We're going to get about 14 more that are going to be very critical to what we want to do. So, we're going to wait on that one just a little bit so we can get a little bit more on that. And then we have the voice chat widget, which we want to activate for all the channels. So, this is the one we're going to select. We're going to hit save. And notice that this is going to be live in 12 days. And the other one that we're going to do is we're also going to go ahead and activate the AI token based usage. So we're going to activate this feature. We're going to select for all sub accounts because it's going to be live in those many days anyway. So it's kind of pointless for us not to move it in there now. And voice conversation support AI. We'll leave that alone for now because we will revisit a little bit later. And I think that's what we're going to do for there. Right. So make sure you turn these on. If not, they're already going to be live by the time you watch this video. Now that being said, let's go over the features. So, we're going to go over to our one of our accounts here. And inside of one of our accounts, we're going to go directly to settings, or if you want to just go directly to AI, Voice Agents, you can go directly there. So, in here, you're going to notice that we have a bunch, and we're going to go all the way up here, and we're going to go to Voice AI. Inside of Voice AI, you are going to notice a little bit of a difference here. One is the reporting is always getting a little bit better. Things are here. You're able to click on these and you're going to get different reports that are going to now pop up. And again, it just goes on and on of like how best it can be in what you're trying to do. And again, high level is always making updates. So, always be very cautious of this. Outbound, like I said, we're going to have a separate one on outbound calling. And then agent list is where all my agent is going to be. Now, again, I'm not going to build a full bot like we did last time because of the whole generation of the prompt in order to do it. But, please go watch that video because nothing's really changed in that aspect except when you first come in, a lot of the new kind of agent tactics have built. and then we're going to go right into the widget. So, the first thing I'm going to do is we're going to build a new agent. I'm going to hit create. Now, you can browse the marketplace. And I got to be honest, there's a lot of really free bots that are pretty amazing. If anybody has watched my good friend Michael Rymer, he does some incredible things with bots. He's got a bunch of them for sale. So, if you want to be super lazy and just buy one for lawyers or buy one for plumbers, go out and do that. If not, you could always go to use the custom GTP builder that I have in the other video that will allow you to basically build one from scratch and do it and customize it yourself. Now, none of this has really changed up here except a few little things I want to call out. First and foremost, you know, you would set up by giving an engine your name. This is going to be we'll just say Mary the salesbot. Okay? And then Mary the salesbot, you're going to put in your business name and then English for the language. Also realize that they now have multi- language support. So multi- languages, it can either do one or the other language, but it would really be diagnosed early on in the conversation. So your bot would have to ask, would you like English or would you like Spanish? And then it'll go from there. The rest are all single language bots, which means that it will start in that language and keep in that language once it's selected. So, just be mindful of that. Now, the voices are pretty cool. They now have over 200 something odd voices, but everybody that we talked to going through all this, you definitely want to select high quality. Jessica is my favorite. It's the one I've been using forever. It's the one from 11 Labs that we also use in the 11 Lab setup. So, just be aware that that's the one you want to use there. And again, you can choose from different accents and different genders. But Jessica's my go-to. You also have Hope. She's also not bad, but high quality just means obviously higher quality, and that's what we're trying to get to, right? Hey, we want to interrupt this video for a quick little minute to just let you know that I hope you're enjoying this video. We want to thank you for being here, but more importantly, we are hoping that this content helps you do whatever you're trying to do inside of High Level. We also want to let you know that you have options to get additional help. We offer a 197 a month VIP coaching program that includes 4 days of office hours first come first serve with Andy or myself where we go in and we answer any of your questions that you might have live with the group setting for other people that are also working in high level. We also have a VIP group where we answer questions directly one-on-one with anybody posting in that group to give you the absolute best support. It also comes with a bunch of other features including our funnel brick system, our little mini course, and more importantly, a couple guides that will help you through this and also including our SOP library that we use for pretty much everything inside of our agency. So, thank you for this quick little minute, but more importantly, go back to the video, get whatever you need, and if you have any questions that we can answer inside the video, just drop a comment on the video and we'll make sure to answer whenever we get a chance. And now back to the show. So, we have Jessica selected time zone again, setting your time zones. This is all initial. And then obviously you have reached digital voltage and you would want to use a noodle taris eventually. I have heard that we are going to get the ability of doing your own voice and that is going to be coming sooner than later. So be mindful of that as that's come. Now this is really cool. Now as you can see there are tons and I mean tons of options now that there were in there before. It's so funny. 40 is 02 cents and you got five that's 0.1. But again a lot of people don't really like five. So a lot of people are doing in here. And look, you even got mini at 0.003 and Nano. And what I love that they did and I really really do love this is that they added Claude, which is one of my favorite, you know, AIS of all time along with the Gemini, which Gemini is doing a lot in the space. And look at the token prices. You're talking about 0001 cents. So, it is definitely becoming a little bit cheaper than the model, but just know that those are available now, which is super, super exciting. They've made some really good deals of buying bulk, and this is kind of the result from it. So, I would 1,000% explore all of these. For instance, I am definitely going to explore Google 2.5 Flash. I'm a big fan. They're doing a lot of headways with voice and we're just going to see how it produces and works based on that. But, if you're not seeing the results, just go back here and switch it to 40, which is the ones we're normally used to inside of this right here. All right. So, those are selected. Those is your preliminary. Now, most important thing that you want to do, though, is you want to get over to advanced settings. Advanced settings. There are new features right here which is the agent behavior and the voice settings. I did go over this last time and again I don't want to do a full review on that because again just go watch that video because that video is pretty in length and it has all that you need. Call time as you guys know I always go to the max because if not exactly after a 15-minute mark it does cut off which is kind of annoying but just be aware that it has that idle time frequency reminder. It's when the bot basically doesn't hear any times like anybody on the phone it says hey just wanted to check if anybody's on or whatever it currently says. And again, 4 seconds. It repeats it as many times as you want. I'll put it as two. And then the agent behavior is, you know, normal speed, moderate, and fast. I never ever ever use fast. I use normal because again, everybody complains that the bot is too fast when you do it in too fast. And the only ones, if you ever listen to me and Mike when we were talking about it, you either want to go to normal or moderate. You never want to go to fast. Interruption sensitivity. This is kind of any background noise or anything else. putting it too high will create any kind of background noise to literally stop the bot and like pause in its questions. And so you want to play with this a little bit. 75 is usually the sweet spot, but sometimes even going all the way to 60 is not bad. So just be mindful of that. But if people have like dogs barking in the background or crazy staticky phones, this will become an issue and that's common everywhere. So just understand that. And LLM temperature means like how wild the bot is going to get in the sense of like making up its own creativity, how it responds. And then you have lower value, better call function calls because it's very specific to the instructions you wrote in the prompts, the FAQs and everything else. So just always keep that in mind. And then your voice settings. This is really cool. This is literally if you watching on YouTube right now and you have me at half speed, which a lot of people do. If you put that to like 1.5, you talk like super fast and it becomes really hard to do. Lowering this a little bit to 0.95 75.85, you're going to get a really good kind of result. One is good, but just be mindful that you might want to play around with that depending on the audience that you serve. Now, the reason I say that is sometimes you might be dealing with a little bit of an older crowd. You got this thing at one, they're not really going to be okay with it. Drop it down to 085 or so, and you're going to notice a pretty big difference in the way the callers react. Voice temperature. And by the way, whenever you have a question of this, it's the expression and the variability of the voice, meaning it goes up and down based on tones. like surprised. Oh my god. You know, to like this is really important. You know, it starts accentuating like everything that you kind of put in the prompt. So, putting this to a higher is going to get it more emotional where the calm voice is always going to, you know, kind of be a little bit more robotic and sound a little bit. So, turning this up and messing around with it a little bit is going to make it a lot of fun for you. But, go ahead and do that. Voice volume. Again, depending on who you're serving, you might want to talk that up to 110, 115. But again, just be very mindful. And then now, if you want to have background noise, you can do that. A lot of people do do call center because they want that call center vibe and feel. If you want to do that, by all means, just hit the call center one and you're ready to rock and roll. Coffee shop somewhere up door. I don't know why any of that or static noise. Why? But if you want it, it's there. Just go ahead and turn it on. I actually tend to leave that off. And I go ahead and confirm. And now I'm going to go to the next. All right. Now, in the next, remember we went over how to create the entire knowledge base in the previous video. So, again, please go make sure you watch that. I'll go over like a little bit slightly, but I already have a knowledge base based on automated marketer 2. We'll just put automated marketer one. And I want to go ahead and collect name, email, and contact issue. And then trigger work when the call is completed. Remember, we built workflows in the previous one that can do a call summary, you know, transcript and all of that. So, please make sure you watch that. The reason why I don't want to go over that, I don't want to go down that rabbit hole. But for instance, if I came in here, and it would be, you know, the one of the workflows that I have for AI, which would be transcript right here, and I would put that on to go on. But again, in this particular case, just be very mindful. You would want to create this to have a very specific workflow that happens at the end of your calls. If you don't, just leave that off. Receive an email notification for post call completion. This is only for, I would say, specific users. Like maybe I want to know when a certain person does, like myself. I don't need all my employees to get it. I would go ahead and do that. And then what I always tend to do is go to switch to advanced mode. Now, this right here is your voice AI usage is built on consumption based on model. Right? So, right now it's talking about how many tokens on average this thing is about to use. The shorter prompts and optimized knowledge base refers to reduce token usage cost. So, I tend to have a pretty long prompt. So, my usage cost might be a little bit better, but it tells you all the different tokens. And as you can read right here, voice engine fixed at six minimum wave for all outbound voice widget calls until December 31st, 2025. That's why taking advantage of that voice widget is going to be pretty awesome because you're going to be able to take advantage of it and pretty much get the usage free while this thing is going on. And we're going to show you how to activate that soon. Going to come over here, switch to advanced mode. As always, I have a prompt. You have the prompt builder that I'll include in the bottom link. That's basically a chat GTP that I did. I designed that custom GTP with Michael Rammer, who is one of the kings of AI voice. And together, what we did is created a really good prompt that is going to give you the best prompt in here. And now, what's crazy is we went from, I think it was 2,000 characters or 2,000 words. We are now able to go to 4,000 words. So, we're actually going to be able to make a little bit of a longer prompt. Now, once the engine is created in advanced code, it can now switch to basic, which we know is perfectly fine. And then as always we set up the actions which again this is all the actions that are going to be working based on that call transfer which we always set up to transfer to human trigger workflow like we did in the previous video which is like you know send directions or do anything that you wanted to do. You have update contact fields appointment booking. Now the only thing and you remember from the previous video you put on appointment booking on this thing this thing gets super aggressive and once it transferred to the appointment booking mode that thing will not stop until it books an appointment. Very aggressive. Just be very aware of that. But again, this is why I usually put it in here only if I wanted to book an appointment. But sometimes you can even have the bot just send out a link. This will always give you better results because it is pretty aggressive. But it does do it in a way that you can communicate with the bot. Not even getting into it. Watch the vibe codings because we did a whole bunch of MCP connections, but I'm also waiting until we get more connections so we can build better and cooler automations when that rolls out. So stay tuned for that. and custom actions for anybody that's like a programmer of any sort. This is where you're going to live because you can do a lot of them in there. For now, the only one we're going to do is call a transfer. Just give you an example. This is going to be transfer to human. All right. And put them a makele number in here. Okay. And then when user asks to speak to human or wants a manager, okay, and say we are transferring you now. Okay. And then I want to hear what's happening when they come in. So, if you hear the whisper message when I pick up the phone and it's transferring to me, it's going to say transferring call from blah blah blah. All right. So, we're going to go ahead and hit save. All right. MCP. Again, we're going to do this a little bit later. Not going to do this now, but if I wanted to add an MCP, this is where I would do it. And then transfer the call once completed. Like I already said, I have a transcript one. We do right there. And then again, only specific users. And the reason I not all admins, I'll take that off. I just want to be notified when that happens. And what's also cool is you can evaluate the prompt to ensure that it gives you the prompted prompt. And again, you got the custom values in here that will do that. Now, evaluating the prompt is a good idea, especially if you're a new person. And even though you're going to use our prompt generator that we're going to link again below on this video, you might want to take a little bit of extra time to just evaluate and make sure it's right. But I can guarantee you that the prompts we're going to generate are going to be pretty good. Just answer the questions in the guide. Go in there, watch the previous video, and it'll go through all that. Now, we have during the call. We also have after the call. I forgot to mention that, but again, it's the same exact thing. You would just pick ones before and after the call when they happen. Now, I'm going to go ahead and hit next. You would select the number in here. And again, all these are pretty much the same. The only thing is if you look over to the right hand side, lo and behold, we can start a web call right now and it can go through there. But I'll actually use it on a agents that's created so you guys can see it. So, I'm going to hit cancel and let's go to our agent list. Let's go to Jessica the FAQbot. This is one that already has everything kind of programmed. And what we're going to do is the web call right in here. And we're going to say start the web call. >> Hey Nuno, you have reached digital volage media. This is Jessica the AI receptionist. In order to best help you, is this a service or a coaching related question? >> I have coaching related. >> Got it. Coaching related questions are my jam. What do you need help with? Are you looking for info on our coaching programs, pricing, or something else? >> Coaching programs. >> All right. We've got some great coaching programs to level up your game. Here's a quick rundown. one VIP access coaching and tech support monthly $197, six months, $985. >> Perfect. All right, so we're going to leave it there, but you guys get the whole entire point. And what's really cool about this is you have the transcript. You can always go back here and do it. You have the recording and you have the summary, right? So, pretty darn cool. But like, hey, how do I get this on a website? Glad you asked, right? So, now what we're going to do now that we have our bot, right? And honestly, like again, the voice was kind of a little bit off. This is again where I would go into advanced settings and I would start messing with the speed behavior on this. The temperature I probably want to accentuate it a little bit more. You know, it was kind of slow. I thought it was pretty all right though. The background noise, I could probably do a call center. Let's hit confirm and save. I just want to see if we could do it. And I'll do new call again. Let's do web call. Remember, free. I don't have to pay. And then I'm going to go ahead and start the web call. >> Hey, Nuno. You have reached Digital Media. This is Jessica the AI receptionist. in order to best help you. Is this a service or a coaching related question? >> Service. >> I'm sending you the link to our sister company, Architects, for any done for you services. They will help you over there. The link has been sent. RCEX will take great care of your service needs. Anything else I can assist you with? >> Now, it's honestly, it's giving really bad like pronunciation, but then I also spelled my own company wrong. [laughter] So, there you go. So, now that that's said, awesome. We're going to go ahead and end the call. And what we're going to do is we're going to activate the widget so we can put it on the website. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to hit the go back button. I'm going to go over to sites on the lefth hand side. In sites on the lefth hand side, I'm going to do a chat widget. Inside the chat widget, we are going to do new. Well, we actually already tried it here, but I'm going to do it with you. Now look, we have oh lo and behold, a voice AI widget. Going to come in here, and this is going to be Jessica the voice AI agent. All right. And just like before when you create any kind of widget and there's preview videos about this you can we start with style right so we're going to come in here you can have the bot and you look over to the right hand side it's all there and we want the phone call all right we are going to do let's say purple have a question how about talk to us here talk with us here okay welcome back name that's perfectly fine widget customization weird it appears all right you could do it on the left everybody by now guys put it always on the bottom right that's where everybody's like kind used to chat window. This is what it's going to look like. You can call from here. Title and intro. Talk to us. Call us here. Fantastic. Powered by. We're going to get rid of HIPPA. Consent is fine. I don't know why that's always there. Messaging is definitely going to be in the United States. And then Jessica is the agent that I am going to select. Now, you have to create the agent for this. So, you have it verily available. And then what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and hit save. Now, I will tell you there is a current feature that they're working on right now. The problem with this right now and it was identified by one of my good friends Dan Doyle. He said that when we were testing it and we were testing and it was collecting information and we thought it was working fine. The only thing it wasn't actually collecting was a phone number because what happens is when you're actually calling and using the website chat widget to like voice talk. It asked for email and name, but it would never ask for the phone number. So, we're currently working with the development team and they're going to probably be adding that in the next few days. So, if it's not working for you right now when you watch this video, just make sure that it's collecting name and phone number because it wasn't for us, but we have put in a request and again the development team is amazing. They'll go back in and they'll add it. Now, the fact that this is done now, what we're going to do is we're going to hit go back. In the go back part, what we're going to do is we're going to go to sites. We're going to go to our funnels, right? And we're just going to do a quick little AI to There's the AI test funnel. Where is it? Here we go. And what we're going to do is we're going to go to settings and we're going to put in the chat widget which is the Jessica the voice AI chat widget or we could do Jessica AI voice. I'm going to go ahead and hit save. Okay. And when you do this you will see now if we view the page check this out. Oh >> hey guest visitor 002. You have reached digital media. This is Jessica the AI receptionist in order to best help you. Is this a service or a coaching related question? >> Uh, coaching. >> Got it. Are you looking for coaching support, training programs, or maybe some info on our VIP access coaching plans? Let me know how. >> All right, perfect. So, now the other thing is, well, wait a second. What if I have a site that is not on high level or I want to put it somewhere else? Great question again. So, we're going to come over here. We're going to go to sites. We're going to go to chat widget. We're going to grab Jessica the AI voice widget. We're going to go ahead and hit edit. And what you're going to do is you're going to come over here and you can get the code. Now, this is a code that you can put either through Google Tag Manager or you can do it in here. So, if I come in here, I'm going to copy it. I'm going to go over to my WordPress site. All right. I'm just going to log in. All right. Once I'm in, I'm going to go over to pages. Inside of pages, what I'll do is I'll pick a particular page. We're just going to go ahead and do, let's see, work with me right here. I'm going to go ahead and hit edit. Now, I'm using Devie Builder. Diva Builder is basically a WordPress design kind of I would say like template resource that you can use or a builder per se. So it's going to be very easy, but basically what you're looking for is either the code element or you're going to use Google Tag Manager. Now I'm not going to go over exactly how to do that on Google Tag Manager. It's a little bit more complex. But if I hit edit with the Divvy Builder, I'm going to leave this site. And what it's going to do, anybody using Elementor Divvy, you can just use the code element inside this. So I'm going to come in here and I'm just going to pick a session like right in here. Actually, let's go all the way to the bottom. And in here at the bottom, there is something that you can add, which is basically a new section. Or you can come in here to your existing section and hit on this little tiny thing. And what I'm looking for is a code element. It'll be different on whatever provider you have. Wix, Squarespace, they all have a code element. And inside the code element, what you're going to do is you're going to copy this script right here. You're going to paste it. All right, we're going to hit check. And we are going to go ahead and save. Believe the code. Oh no, it was here somewhere. Uh-oh. Let's make sure it's there. And let me grab this right here. Copy. Paste. Now, we might have to do a little bit extra work because I don't know if that necessarily worked. Yep, it did. Here we go. And I come in here and this is on the website. >> Hey, guest visitor 003. You have reached digital volage media. This is Jessica the AI receptionist. In order to best help you, is this a service or a coaching related question? >> Coaching related question. >> Got it. What's your question? I'll do my best to help >> you guys get it. How cool is that? You can now put it on the website. Pretty badass as you go through. But again, remember I got it over here. I got a get code and I was able to put it in a code document. You also can get it for WordPress and you can load up the lead connector and it automatically does it too. I did it that way. Simple simple easy way because then with that code element you can add in Wix, Squarespace, wherever you have your website. But I thought it was really really cool. That's technically it. We're going to get deeper into the MCP servers. We're going to get deeper into conversational AI. But again, watch the previous video to develop your prompt. I'll include the links below as far as going to your prompt generator. And then more importantly, try out the chat widget, throw it on some sites. I thought it was pretty cool. I think this is going to be an absolute game changer for a lot of people out there. And if I was going to turn anything on, it would totally be this because again, some of the usage charges that are associated to this are going to be free until December 31st. That gives us three months of generating leads. And I think that that's going to be pretty awesome. So, with that being said, enjoy it and we'll see you on the next one. >> [music]",
