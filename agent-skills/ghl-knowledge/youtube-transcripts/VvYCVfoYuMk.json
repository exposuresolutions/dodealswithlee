  "transcript": "This is the ultimate 2025 GoHighLevel AI voice agents tutorial. I will show you how to create an AI\nvoice agent that books clients 24 7, delivers stellar customer service\nand sounds incredibly human-like. Plus I will show you how to use\nany phone number even outside of Go high level for your AI voice agents. And we will do all of this in minutes. Let's jump right in. So we're gonna come right into our\ngo high level dashboard and we're gonna come right down to AI agents. But instead of starting immediately\nin the voice AI tab, we're actually gonna start with the knowledge base. This is a little hack that's gonna\nsave you, a couple minutes of time. It's just something I've figured\nout with this new layout. And if you don't know what the knowledge\nbase is, it is basically where the AI agent pulls from to talk to leads. So it's the data that it's trained on. AI agents and AI chat bots\ndon't just know everything. They have to be trained\non specific data sets. That's how this process works. So what I'm gonna do is first show\nyou how to properly train this and then show you how this is a shortcut\nin making this process faster. Again, starting with the knowledge\nbase is just gonna make training your AI voice agents way faster. So we're just gonna click create\nknowledge base, and you're gonna plug in the name of the sub-account here. A knowledge base, I believe, as\nyou want in each sub account, but we're just gonna start with one. Okay? So the first thing we are gonna\nwant to do is we're gonna want to put the client's website in. This is so important because we\nwant it properly trained on pricing, FAQs and all that good stuff. And again, you can add FAQs down here if\nyou don't have the website or whatnot. But this will get a lot of\nthose answers who are good. So we're just gonna click get data and\nit's going to go through, it's basically going to plug in the website, FET\nyour pages so it can now pull from it. So now I wanna show you a little\nhack that's gonna make your AI agent perform even better. And it's not just plugging in its\nwebsite, it's basically plugging in all the data on a niche possible. That's why I have created this prompt\nfor you to use will be right down below that will fast track this process. I've taken a lot of time in making this. I've had to craft this and test this\nso many times, but it works so well. So all you're gonna do. Is you're gonna copy this exact pro, okay? You're going to come into chat, GBT\nor whatever Aus you're gonna paste. And then what you're going to do is\nyou're going to plug in your niche. So we're gonna do plumber and what this\nis going to do is this is going to get all of the plumber stuff I can think of. So it's a master at the plumbing niche. And then what we can do is we can plug it\nin so it also knows everything plumbing. So it's important to train it\nextra for it to work better. So again, this is incredibly\nimportant in training your bot and soon you're gonna be able to upload\nfiles, which is gonna be awesome. 'cause you could probably upload a\nvoice file, which would be so amazing. So that'd be crazy good. But as of right now, we're just\ndoing it through the web crawler. So now we're gonna go back to\nchat, GBT, and we're going to copy. All of the stuff that it let\nout, all of this amazing stuff. So we're going to copy this. Then what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna come to a Google sheet or you can go to a webpage on\nyour website or really anything. is we're going to paste all of this in\nhere, and we now have basically a extra database with all things plumber related. Then you can come right in here. You can come here, you can\nclick anyone with the link. And then what we do is\nwe're gonna copy the link. there's all kinds of different softwares. You can even plug this in on\na website page if you wanted. But we just need a way to\nbasically plug this in. So once we have that\ncopied, what we're gonna do. So we're gonna come here and\nwe're going to paste this just like we put in with the website. Now it is trained on two different\nURLs, So this is the key part in training the AI chat bot. Number one, it knows all things\nabout the company that is trained on, hence the website. And number two, it knows\nall things about the niche. So it's an expert of both and\nit has more context to answer. Again, this is a big reason why a\nlot of people mess up is their AI chat bots aren't properly trained\nbecause they don't have enough data. So now that this all looks\ngood, we're gonna go back to all Knowledge bases and you'll see\nit's right here, Dave's Plumbing. If you wanna edit it, you just click\nthis or delete it, just like that. But now that we have Dave's\nPlumbing Knowledge Base set, we're now gonna come to AI Voice Agents\nand set this entire process up. So we're gonna come right in here. We're gonna click Create Agent, and we're\ngonna just breeze through this process. so first thing, we are\ngoing to name our chappa. We're just gonna do, Rebecca,\nleave the business name in here. You can pick whatever language you want. So scroll through on\nwhat language you want. Then we have the voices. This is really important because they\nhave a ton of different voices in a ton of different languages, and you want\nto pick what fits your business best. So if you wanna test out a voice,\nwe click Phoebe and we just go play. The greatest part of our happiness depends\non our disposition, not our circumstances. We will click Jennifer. The IC is only what the mind\nis prepared to comprehend. Okay, we will do. Mark. Happiness can exist only in acceptance. So you pick whatever voice you want. Okay?\nJust like this. It's so easy, it's so simple. but I would go through it and\npick which one you want first. So pick what you want, go\nthrough them, test them. and again, you can just\nclick play to test them. But then from there, you're good. Then you're gonna pick the time\nzone of the bot inbound call. We don't have outbound yet,\nso that just stays the same. Then we have agents initial message. So this is exactly what the AI\nchat bot's going to say first when it picks up the phone. So this is pretty good what we have\nhere, but you can tweak this and have it be like, Hey, what's up? Or like, Hey, how you doing? Like make it more simple. But this is pretty good what we have here. So once all of this is good and\nyou're like, okay, I like all this. We're gonna go to advanced settings. ' cause this is just the last part in this\nprocess, which is a couple of last tweaks. So we can have call limit in case\nthat's how long the call goes. You can do response speed,\nso how fast it responds. Then you can have idle time reminder,\nwhich is how long it'll be idle after people just are silent. So I would maybe even do like five\nseconds or four seconds on this. then you'll be good. So I wouldn't go much further. But these are just a little extra\nadditional settings as you see here. You can pick what you want,\nbut I think most of it's good. And you may wanna put a time limit on\njust so people aren't yapping forever. ' cause this does cost money. And then once this is all good,\nwe're just going to click next. So now when we come to do is select\nthe knowledge base the reason I had you do this first is if you do\nthis the other way around, this is just a little high level, pro tip. So in this new setup, you actually\nhave to leave the AI voice agent, go into knowledge base, created, set\nit up, then come back out, then come back in, and then come to agent goals. So it's like an extra minute to two\nminutes of going back and you have to like redo your steps, where if you just\ndo this first, it makes it much cleaner. And again, it's like a one\nto two minute difference. It's huge. So we're gonna click that right there. Then very important, we want\nto switch to advanced mode. This is another thing a\nlot of people are doing. It's why their chat bot isn't\nanswering the way they want it. So you may be like, what the heck is this? It's a prompt. Guess what? I have another prompt for you. This again, is yours\nfree right down below. This will save you so much time and\nmake your chat bot work so much better. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna\ncopy this big, big boy right here. Okay? We're going to click copy and then\nwe're gonna come back into Chad g Bt, and we're gonna paste this. And now what you have to do is you\njust have to fill out each of these so when we plug it back in, it is\ncompletely trained on your business. This will save you so\nmuch time and stress. So the first thing, we're\ngonna enter the bot's name. So remember the name you put in for it. It'd be Rebecca. Okay?\nThe business name. You're gonna put your\nbusiness name in here. So we're going to do Dave's Plumbing. Awesome.\nSure. Space. Then we're gonna put the business types. So guys, this is the niche. If you didn't know, so we're\ngonna do plumber mission. So what is the goal? Services. So I would just be more general. I would say like general plumbing. Services and then maybe main one is\nhot water installs, and then any ones you absolutely do not do, you can\nplug them in there just so it knows. But again, it's already,\ngetting the website plugged in, so that should be good. We're gonna do general, by the\nway, it already knows my spelling, so it doesn't really matter. but then we're gonna do personality. This one's important. So what do you want the\npersonality of the bot to be? Do you want it to be happy,\nmean, rude, whatever. So we're gonna do. Cheerful and patient. then tone. Sim. Pathetic. and then the feeling. This is really important guys,\nbecause this is gonna help a lot. You wanna do cared for and validated. This is what people want, especially\nwhen it comes down to stuff like. Customer service, this is\nreally, really important. And then good vibe. This is kinda how they end the call. So we're just gonna do amazing. Have an amazing day, and\nthen we're gonna click enter. And what this is gonna do is it's gonna\ntake all of these, so the personality tone, it's going to fill them out all\nin these different brackets and it's gonna basically create super data Guys. I wish you could understand\nhow much this is going to help you if you don't understand ai. Like this took me so long to build\nbecause a lot of people think they can just go to chatGBT and\ngenerate a prompt and you're done. No, it actually doesn't work that way. You generate something, you plug it\nin and the AI agent still messes up. So I've had to spend so much\ntime crafting this to get it to work just the way I wanted it. that's why this is such a hack 'cause\nit's gonna help you so much more. So we're gonna come right back\nto ChatGBT, and we're gonna get all of this that we just got. Okay, we're gonna copy this. We're gonna come back in here and\nwe're gonna paste it right in here. so now we have the prompt that's\ngoing to train this on its personality and basically telling it what it is. Again, huge hack. It's gonna make it work much better now. Okay, the actions you want it to take. Now if you click new action here, you\nget call transfer trigger workflow, send SMS update, contact field book\nan appointment, or a custom action. So I'm gonna walk you through\nthese and what each of these does. So first one is call transfer. So in call transfer, you can have the AI\nagent transfer the call to a real human. Okay. And the way you do this is you put\nin the name, you pick the number you want it to be transferred to, then\nyou put in when you want it to happen. So when they say, send me a human, or\nI wanna book an appointment, whatever you want it to be, put it in there. And then what to say right before. So it'd be like, okay, you're now\nbeing transferred to an agent and once you have this set up, what this\nis gonna do, as soon as they say a certain phrase, it's going to transfer\nthe call from the agent to a human. This is killer for sales process. And you can use these for\nsetters too if you didn't know. But once that's all good,\nyou can then click save. whisper message is just like the press\ntwo for lead that pops up to warn them. but other than that,\nthat's how culture works. It's very, very straightforward\nand very simple. trigger a workflow, so\nthis is really cool. You can have your AI agent. Trigger an actual automation in high\nlevel when it says anything, which is huge, it could be like a nurture\nsequence based on the phone number. It could be sending an\nSMS, it could be whatever. And again, to start this, you put\nin the action name, you select the exact workflow you want, then you\nhave when to trigger the workflow. So when they say a certain\nword or whatever, you plug that in and then what to say. when the workflow is being triggered. So it could be like, I\njust sent you a text. You put it in there, very\nsimple, very straightforward. You just follow that\nand you're good to go. Then you click save, and then\nyou have your workflow triggered. Then you have send SMS. This is how you can send\nan SMS to them live. so you could be like, Hey,\ndid you get the appointment? And then boom, you sent\n'em a text or whatever. Hey, I'm gonna text you the\ndetails, whatever you want. Again, you can get creative with\nthis, but you put in your action name, you type in your message, or\nyou put in an SMS template like this. Boom, check that out. If you don't understand SMS templates, go\nwatch more other videos to create those. Then you can put when should SMS. Delivery take place. Again, just like all the others,\nwhen they say a certain phrase or whatever the scenario is, you put\nin there and it's gonna do it. Then what to say before sending a SMS. You can be like, Hey, we just\ntexted you, so fill those in. Just like that. Very simple. Click save guys. Again, if you have any questions\non this, just let me know down below in the comments and I'll\nanswer as quickly as possible. Then we have update contact field. And what this does is this basically\ncan update contacts in go have, so it could change it to, you\nknow, putting a, a tag on it. It could change the first\nname, the number, whatever you want it, it can do it. to do this, you plug in action name. you pick the contact field\nthat you want changed. It could be a custom field too. You pick when to do it, just\nlike the others when they say it. You can overwrite an existing contact\nfield and then you put in the example. That way it goes in and it will\nswitch a contact field, based on what you say, which is cool. And then you can do this during the call,\nso it can ask them that way during the call or you can do it after the call. So as soon as the call ended. It then moves that contact to warm\nleader or whatever the tag you wanna put in, or really whatever you guys want. But that one's pretty cool. And then you just click\nsave and then you're done. So after this, we now move on to the most\nimportant, which is booking appointments. this is amazing because what you can\ndo with this is you can have your AI agent book appointments for you. This is like one of the most valuable\nparts, and it's cool because they will actually book appointments\nin your calendar with their email, with reminders set up like this. You can solve for a lot of money guys. This is awesome. And the way to do that is very simple. Once you click book appointment, you\npick the exact calendar you want. You then Days of offering dates. Then you click appointments per\nslot, and then hours between slots. So this is very simple. It is very straightforward. You pick what you want. I think these are great The way\nit is, I think you just gotta pick your calendar, and once that\nlooks good, you then click save. And now this part is set up,\nso then it's ready to move on. Booking appointments, and again, you guys\nhave to plug this in for this to work. I see a lot of people where they\nskipped this and they're like, why isn't it booking appointments? It's like, because you\ndidn't set it up properly. And you can see right here it's\nkinda got these cool little cards. It makes it look better. but last but not least,\nwe have custom action. This is in beta mode. This is basically doing like stuff\nwith web hooks or real custom stuff inside, and go high level. This is a little confusing, but you put\nin your action name, you put the same thing when you want it to happen, Then\nyou put when to execute the action. So after they say something or whatever. And then you have where it gets a little\nmore complicated, which is putting in APIs, variables, all kinds of stuff. I'm not really gonna go over\nthis because I don't do a lot of stuff with custom webhooks. at least on this end, I do it behind\nthe scenes, but not like for each clamp. but this, if you want to get real\nsneaky with it, just know that this is where you can do that. Then when you're done, you just click\nsave or you can test your web hook. So those are the actions that's very\nimportant that you set those up guys. depending on what you're doing, you\nwant to make sure that is solid. Then what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna come right down here. Last, but least you can trigger a\nworkflow when the call is completed. You can kind of already do that with\ntriggering a workflow, but again, this is another way you can do it. You can click this, you\npick the workflow you want. This is really great because\nthis can immediately get people in nurture sequences. Again, guys, this is how\nyou make a lot of money. and then right here you can receive email\nnotifications after the call is completed. And I recommend just leaving\nthis as all admins, unless you want to assign to a specific user\nlike someone who's contacting it, but pick which one you want. And then once you're done,\nyou're gonna click next. So now we move on to the last part,\nwhich is phone and availability. So the first thing I want to go over\nis just pricing and how this works. So basically you have two different\noptions for using your AI voice agent. You have per usage, which I believe\nis 13 cents on the gold website per minute, which actually isn't bad. Or you can pay 97 a month and\nget unlimited of all ai, which actually is pretty dang handy\nif you're doing high volume. I don't recommend you use AI employee. If you have, low volume, 'cause you're\nliterally just gonna spend more. If you're doing not a lot of calls,\nbreak down the basic math right here with the calculator and you'll\nknow that it's not a good deal But if you have high volume, know with\nAI employed with 97 a month, you can basically get everything unlimited. So if you have a client that's doing\nchat and voice agents reviews, ai, everything, this could be awesome. Buy it for nine, seven a month\nand then upsell this exact thing down for 3, 4, 500 bucks. And it's very valuable. They'll keep paying, but\nyou get it way cheaper. So this is like a really, really\ngood deal if that's what you want. so if you sign up using my link right\ndown below, or my go high level link, just to let you know, you'll get\naccess to trainings on how to sell, go high level Trainings on how to master\nhigh level trainings on how to use AI, like in depth, tons of prompts. Okay. Private community, tons of free\nsnapshots, like snapshots in every vertical like insane ones,\nagency ones, the whole nine yards. I mean, so much stuff. For free. If you're using either go high level\nor my AI employee link, which again, I recommend you check out because you\nwill get it for free if you sign up. Even with that 30 day free trial link. There was also a, free trial\nlink for the AI employees. You can test all this stuff, which\nI recommend you guys do, so you can learn how to use it, but also. It's a no brainer because by you\nsigning up, you're getting all of this extra stuff for free. Again, I've won a ton of awards. I have a ton of testimonials. You can see on the link right\ndown below, you will see, like I have the proof to show you that\nI know what I'm talking about. I also go the extra mile in the trainings\nand make sure you're up to date, and it's the kind of thing where if you want to\ntake this and really do well with this. It's a no brainer for you. And again, it's free if\nyou're using high level. So go check that out. But Now we move on to one of the\nreally cool parts, which is picking your phone number, but also using\nother people's phone numbers. This is something I'm not seeing a lot of\nother people online on YouTube do right now, because they dunno how to do it. But I'm gonna show you right now. So the first thing you can do. As you can pick the number\nyou have in go high level. So you just select it like this\nand then you're good to go. Or you can click buy number. Okay? It's gonna take you to the phone numbers\nand you can quickly add a number. I have other videos on this that are very\nsimple and very straightforward, but you can just add a number by coming in and\nclicking add number, like it's so easy. You just pick whatever number\nyou want like this and buy, it's a dollar for a number. and if you already have a go high level\nnumber like I do, again, you can just select it right here and then you're done. But you now may be like, well, my client\nalready has a phone number and this is the cool part, and I've done this with a lot\nof clients, is where it becomes awesome. And we can set up call forwarding. So whenever someone calls the AI\nagent or however you know, they get in contact with it, it's immediately\ngoing to forward to their number. So you may then be like,\nwell, wait a minute. They have a phone number though. They don't want to use a new phone number. This is what you can do, and\nthis is an awesome trick. It's called Call forwarding. Now, you can do this both\ndifferent ways, okay? You can do this from their number\ngoing to AI voice agent, or the AI voice agent going to their number. I'm gonna show you how to do it in high\nlevel depending on what number they have. So you can come right in\nhere to edit configuration. And all you're gonna do is\nyou're gonna put in the number you want it forwarded to. Very simple, very straightforward. You plug in the number, you know right\nhere, and then you basically go through. So any other little basic stuff like this. So use verified. Number is caller ID enable. Call connect feature, whisper\nmessage, which is like we have a lead for you on the phone and\nany other little things you want. And then click save. And it's now going to forward\nthese calls to that number. And again guys, if they're using\nanother number, you can just set up call forwarding to go to the AI voice agent. It works both ways. So if they have at and t, Verizon,\nT-Mobile, you do the same thing, guys. I'm telling you, it's so easy to do. You can even do it on\ntheir app, I believe. but that way you're sending to\nthe number or you're sending this. To their number, however you want to go. It's call forwarding. You do it very simple like that Again,\nyou just click edit configuration and you plug it in just like this. And you can do this on\nliterally every carrier. It's so simple. It's so straightforward. And this is a hack for getting them to\nnot have to switch their phone number because a lot of people don't wanna\nswitch their phone number because people already know their phone number. you know, it would be like a\nbranding nightmare and, and a lot of leads would be confused. But you can just set up call\nforwarding and then you're done. So like that's a really good hack. 'cause a lot of people are like constantly\nasking me like, oh my gosh, like how do I use, you know, my client's number? Like, the answer is call forwarding. And again, you can do this in\nhigh level and any other app, it's basically the same thing. and this is just such a hack because\nif you have someone that's getting high volume and they're like, oh, I\ndon't want to keep, you know, plugging people in, doing all this crap. Like, you set up call\nforwarding and you're done. Enable AI agent as backup to phone\nnumbers, pool if you wanna do that, if you want, you know, says if call forwarding\nnumber doesn't respond, which is great, which is if you know you have agents,\nmultiple people, and then someone's busy, it'll take over, which is awesome. And then you basically can set\nworking hours for agent, which can be 24 7 or you pick the exact days. But I recommend it's 24 7. It's just way better. from there, everything looks good. We then click save, and\nthen your AI agent is done. That's the setup process. So in your AI voice agent, if you want\nto edit all, you click these three dots. You can click edit, duplicate if\nyou want two of them or delete it. But now what I want to do is I want to\ntest the AI bot, so you now know that this is real, and I actually wanna show\nyou why you need to test this a lot and not just immediately make this live. before I do that, I just wanna let\nyou know, dashboard and logs is pretty cool 'cause this is going to be all of\nthe data based on your bot, how long their calls are, where they came from. It's gonna have all the data right\nhere, which is, I recommend you look at ' cause data is king and it's\nhow you get better with this stuff. But now what I want to do is I\nwanna start testing this bot so we can now see how well it works. So what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna come right in here and we're going to put in the number we want. We're going to do plus 1 5 4 0 5 5, 4, 6. 4, 5, 2. Okay. And then what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna call, and what I want to do is I wanna walk you through\nand I wanna book an appointment. I actually wanna like test this bot. See it works. I wanna prove to you guys that it works. Hello. Hi there. How can I assist you today? Hey, I'm just trying to get, my poopy\ntoilet fixed and yeah, I need an appointment ASAP with, Dave's Plumbing. Got it. Let's get that sorted for you. Do you want to book an appointment? I can suggest some available\nslots for the next few days. Do you guys have Thursday open by chance? Let me check that for you. We have openings on Thursday\nat 8:00 AM 11:00 AM and 2:00 PM What time works best for you? 2:00 PM please. Great choice. Before we proceed, could you please\nprovide your email address so we can send you the appointment confirmation? Yes. It's going to be Lord declan777@gmail.com. Thank you. Just to confirm, your email is\nL-O-R-D-D-E-K-L-A-N 7 7 7 at dm a i l.com, is that correct? No, it's, a, a c instead of a k. Got it. So it's L-O-R-D-D-E-C-L-A n777@dmai.com. Is that right? Yes, that's it. your appointment is all set for Thursday,\nMay 29th at 2:00 PM you'll receive a confirmation email Thank you so much. Have a great day and good\nluck with the plumbing. Hey, one last thing. I just wanna say thank you so much\nand I hope you have a great day. Thank you. I really appreciate it. Have a fantastic day and goodbye. Alright, peace. So that was pretty cool. I said a C instead of a K, and it\nliterally knew exactly what to say. If you send that to a human,\nthey might be like, Okay. And they might take a\nsecond, like out of context. I put no context. That's insane. I don't really like Mark's voice. That's the, agent we use in here. If we go to agent, mark, I\nprefer some of the other ones. 'cause some of 'em sound more human-like. That one's good. It's good. but I'm not the biggest fan. But now what I want to do is I want to\ngo over and I want to actually see if it booked my appointment on the calendar. So now we're gonna come back here\nand we're gonna go up to calendars. Let's do estimate call. I believe that was when\nwe picked, look at that. How freaking cool is that? We come right in here. we got meeting with Declan,\nLord Declan seven Gmail. Got it perfectly. Got the phone number, got\neverything, plugged it in. We're done. How cool was that? imagine you get someone with high\nvolume that's getting a lot of calls in. This can just fill their calendar. You can use this as a setter. You can use this as customer service. You can use this as a sales bot,\nlike this is the future guys. I talk about this all the time on my\nchannel, but like it needs repeating. AI is the future. You're not gonna escape it. There's no way. Okay?\nIt's just becoming very powerful. You need to take advantage of\nit now so you can make money. This isn't some sort of scare tactic. This isn't a joke. It is taking over. You can see the way the\nworld is moving right now. Everything is moving towards ai. If you can get on this now, there\nare like untold riches waiting. Like I, I've never seen anything\nmove this quickly that can solve this many problems and it's so easy\nto set up like I just did this. I mean, the value this\nis providing is unreal. Okay? Like most things, like\nyou gotta build a website. It takes so much time. Email campaigns, so much time, like\nreputation management, all these things can take a lot of time. This is very little effort for the amount\nof money you can make on autopilot every single month without having to do that. Much like the arbitrage of work\nvalue and money is insane here. And again, guys, these tactics are how\nI win all these awards on the wall. I use the most cutting edge stuff\nand I use the best strategies and the best ways of setting up, which\nI just showed you now, and I give it to local service business owners. So three last little pro tips I\nwanna show you is when you get this set up immediately, make sure the\nGoogle business profile, again, if you have call forwarding this work. So don't worry about it, but you wanna\nmake sure all the numbers across all of their profiles have the AI voice\nagent, So many people will not connect this everywhere and it loses its impact\nwhen it's only in a couple You want this to hit really hard by having it\neverywhere, especially on the website. Make sure you rig this up. You have it all over the website. The last thing I wanna show you is\nmake sure you test this thing, okay? You can test this, I think for\n10 minutes for free every single day if you come right in here. Please test, test, test. Like this is like one of the\nmain things I can say to you. 'cause if you test it, you'll see\nif it has flaws or you'll see if your prompt isn't good enough. You'll also see if the knowledge base and\nthe data you put in wasn't good enough, but maybe the website needs pages at it. So it's like a little SEO thing. This is gonna make it\nwork that much better. This is so important that you do this. Like, I could not say this enough,\nso please make sure you test a lot, and you make sure you get it just the\nway you want, and then you release this bad boy and it's game over and\nthen you do this for every client and you rack in that recurring money.
