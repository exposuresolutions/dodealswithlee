  "transcript": "all right if you are thinking about building an app for high LEL a plugin an automation whatever the case may be I'm going to explain to you the biggest pitfalls that you're going to come into um this is going to help you not have to redo all the work that you end up doing okay and why should you listen to me well I've built several apps well actually that's a lie I've built one app that makes several hundred and I've worked with several clients to help them Implement different automations for their businesses in uh high level so let's talk about the biggest pitfalls now the first and biggest Pitfall is is keeping it all within high level let me just let me just oh oh J uh keeping it all in ghl and by the way if you're watching this video still I recommend putting it at 1.5 or two times speed just so you don't fall asleep because I need to get that actually no you should fall asleep so I get more view duration regardless this is the biggest mistake that I see people making is they try to keep everything within high level so you could technically do your workflows within high level like um I'll just put this so workflows you could use like web Hooks and you know Custom Custom actions to um to automate everything instead of using like zapier or n or whatever but even if you are smart enough to use something like zapier or n or your own server to run all the actions you're going to run into another um problem which I'll call it the source uh I'll just call it the source of truth I think I think people will call it this SSO single source of Truth not single sign on anyways um what you what a lot of people want to do is they want to say okay high level is like the home base for our business this is what everything should go through so if we're updating a contact we want to make the change directly in high level and have everything run through high level okay so so let's maybe draw this out so basically high level is going to be database this is going to be a database um structure and then you would have events happening in high level whatever your app is processing or doing you would have stuff happening in high level and then on the other side you would have like I'll just do like the zapier no I won't do the zapier logo I'll do the n logo you would have like n here which is processing like your your actions workflows [Music] whoops and then that would be sending data back to high level now this seems fine but it's actually very problematic because you're going to run into problems where you're trying to change things within high level that just can't be can't be managed very well um especially within the workflows that are built into high level and so what actually helps a ton especially if you're if you're using different apps like let's say we have high level here but we also have you know maybe we have have um like Square which is like say that's your your payment processor then you have to also keep this thing in sync and this is not a database so it can't be a single source of Truth you would actually want to have a a separate database here and in databases um you know in the business World maybe if you're a developer watching this uh you know this doesn't seem like a big deal but if you're not a developer you look at this and you think okay air table like air table I mean that can get expensive or notion or Google Sheets no no no no no no you don't need that you need something like superp base or or Firebase or uh just like a basic like postgress database like it really doesn't matter um just something like these these are built for applications that actually scale and so you're going to be able to host a ton of data on here and run a lot of automation before it really costs you anything you know and then even when it does cost you something it's still extremely cheap okay so this is um this is going to be your best option and basically the biggest Advantage here is that we're going to be able to have your single source of of Truth here that you can look at whenever you make whenever something happens or whenever you need to update data you can look at this source of data and and compare it to be able to make changes so if you have a customer ID or let's say you have a customer stored in high level with a phone right well if if someone updated their phone somewhere else you might have to come straight into high level and then you might have to update it um but then you would have to also do the same thing in square and this is actually a bad example because that would probably be fine but what you could do is you could have a phone stored here and you could go okay what's the phone number that we're that we're looking for okay so we found a customer with this phone number now let's use the customer ID that we has that has that phone in high level update them and then update them in square and this is going to allow you to keep track of multiple phone numbers you know emails like and keep customer profiles way more organized like here's the main thing is you can actually add your own layers of of organization to this database while high level really doesn't offer that I mean you can add custom fields and they have custom objects now but there's always going to be limitations um especially once you start messing with custom with either of those you'll find out why why you want a single source of Truth like this okay so this is this is my first piece of advice is have a single source of Truth um built in okay and now so let me put a big fat one here because this is our F our first pro tip now our second Pro tip is going to be this one so what we're going to say is a lot of people you know no offense cuz I know you're guilty of this personally I'm guilty of this is everyone wants to make funnels work for everything okay so you know if it's a booking they'll put it there if it's a website they'll put it there if it's a some type of custom functionality they'll put it there or an Ecom store they'll put it there and that's great you know that's cool highle definitely intends to have you do that that's how they sell it you know it replaces every single tool it's the Jack of all trades but I say jack of all trades master of none before I go into that okay never mind so funnels yes Ecom everything like that but what I what I highly recommend is if you're if you're building something with any complication so let's say you're building a scheduling software and you're trying to replace um jobber right so jobber is a scheduling software but it has a lot of different features um better than high level I'm not an expert in Java but I just know based on High level they're far behind Java in terms of specific features now what you could do is you could try to make it work you could do a bunch of hacks and have a really shitty form and and that might work because I always say keeping things simple is the best way to build it right you want something that's simple because you have to start with something simple to be able to build on it in the future um but what people do oftentimes is they over complicate things okay and if you can get it done in a day because you're keeping it simple and it's not the most optimized thing that's fine okay it's it's a business at the end of the day you know it's not all about this one feature um it's going to be about everything combined so so it's fine if you leave some features out but when it does kind come time to implement these features [\u00a0__\u00a0] um what you're going to want to do is actually build a custom app that can do that so bear with me for a second so let's say um let's say you were selling Ecom and you were like God this funnel that high level has blows right now the the the the cool thing about I mean I'm talking about in terms of custom code okay you can hire a developer like me to do it or you can find a developer or you can do it yourself or whatever there's a lot of different to skin a cat but if you're having trouble I was just talking to someone today who is having trouble with an Ecom store they can't use Shopify because they need hippoc compliance and there's not really any good options um so what they could do and what I would almost recommend is because they're trying to PC mail everything together and because high level is frankly never going to catch up to Shopify it's always going to be behind what you can do is you can almost build a very kind of simple version of an online store and so you can build all this functionality out you know you have like your listings you have add to cart you have a cart you have a cart icon up here and then you have a checkout and this is I mean this is not easy to implement right this is going to take a while but what you get is a custom interface you don't have to deal with high levels like [\u00a0__\u00a0] development speed where it takes [\u00a0__\u00a0] 18 years to get something built out you know I think the workflow still use GPD 4 they switched to it literally right after 40 came out it's like they're never going to be current okay so you either live with it or you do what we're talking about here so you can build out your own custom solution to whatever it is especially you know if this is booking too A lot of people have trouble with the booking um the booking like funnels is what you can do is you could also just build out your own booking funnel right so you could just build out there's probably an open source version or if you use like bubble or some [\u00a0__\u00a0] like that you could probably get you know uh you know some sort of calendar solution just like this with some forms and a date picker and all you have to do now is whenever someone books here or whatever they buy here you send the relevant data over to or actually so what you would do is every time this page loads you would look at the URL for your client right and that's you would create a multi-tenant app so this is uh I've made a couple videos about this but basically you have the same app and you can use it at different URLs if you think about high level if you log into app.you bus.com it's going to be different than app. myus.com it's the same app but the logo the details the information are different and that's exactly what you're going to be doing here if you if you have multiple clients so you can just do that here or if it's your own business then obviously you don't need that um but all you would do is when the page loads you would pull out the relevant data from your database you know or you could potentially use high level but I would not recommend it because it's definitely not optimized for that like I was saying earlier um so you would pull out the relevant data and then whenever the the action is taken on this page then you can just okay wait hang on this should be a backward Arrow all right whatever you get the idea so basically we're exchanging database data here to set up the pages the right way and then whenever someone you know purchases or books we can just send all that data out to high level using their API okay their their API is extremely powerful and so you can build your own front-end Solution on top of high level and just have it integrate well with high level this becomes a sellable asset if you Jerry rig some [\u00a0__\u00a0] in a funnel that is not a sellable asset that's a liability every time high level changes something you're going to have to fix it and at at the end of the day you're building on someone else's platform it's a huge liability no one wants to buy your business but if you actually build a software or tool like this that integrates with high LEL and potentially with HubSpot or I don't even know another CRM but if you build an actual tool like this then that's a sellable asset and you have you have full control over this you can actually decide what goes on this page what it looks like how it works and everything like that and the API for high level will allow you to keep everything in sync with your client's account or your account and it can be basically completely automated with sub account creation and getting everything set up so this is my recommendation I dude I get people reaching out to me all the time who are just Jerry rigging the [\u00a0__\u00a0] out of high level it hurts to see and um yeah this is my biggest advice is actually use an a third you know an external source of Truth and also use like a custom web page um if you have custom functionality you need because this is going to be far easier than trying to Jerry rig some [\u00a0__\u00a0] so thank you for watching check the link below I have an agency where I can help you actually build out something like this um I am pretty busy at the moment so if you want to get help it's probably better to do it sooner rather than later um but yeah anyways thanks for watching see you in the next video",
