  "transcript": "- Hey, I'm Dan. And in this tutorial, I'll walk you step by\nstep through GoHighLevel, one of the most powerful\nall-in-one marketing and sales platforms for small businesses. It combines CRM, email\nmarketing, scheduling, payments, and other tools all into\none single platform. Especially if you're a beginner, GoHighLevel has so much functionality that it's normal to feel\noverwhelmed at first, but don't worry. In this tutorial, I'll show you the initial setup process, and I'll guide you through\nall of the features so that you don't miss a thing. That way, you'll know what\nGoHighLevel is capable of and where you can find the\nmost important features for you and your business during your free trial period. The first thing we're gonna do is get ourselves a 14-day\nfree trial for GoHighLevel. To claim your free trial, just scroll down to the\ndescription of this video and click the first link\nthat you find there. That link will take you\nto the correct signup page where you can claim your free trial. To start signing up, click on the 14 Day Free Trial button, then enter your business details, and click here to go to Step 2. I'll choose the $97-a-month\nstarter plan here, and I would recommend\nchoosing that for most people. You can always switch to the\nunlimited plan at any time during the 14-day free trial. Next, enter your credit card number, agree to HighLevel's terms, and click here to start\nyour 14-day free trial. Next, you'll have a short\nonboarding sequence. Choose a password here, and then click Continue. Then, verify your email by entering the code sent to your inbox. Then, do the same thing to\nconfirm your phone number. Next, enter your billing\naddress and click Continue. I'll say that I plan to use\nHighLevel as a business owner to manage my business and Continue. If you're just using it for your business, then you likely won't resell HighLevel. Continue again, and then\ndon't worry too much about what to select for industry, but I'll search for media company, and choose that, and Continue. For the purposes of the trial, I'll say I don't have any customers yet. As for first focus, I'll select Others, and don't worry what you pick because I'll guide you through the functionality within the tutorial. Click Continue, and\nfinally I'll click Skip on setting up other tools for the moment. You can earn a $15 credit by joining an onboarding call, but let's go to your account now, and I'll show you the other\ncredit opportunities shortly. After creating your account, you'll land on the launchpad, which you can see here in the\nleft hand navigation pane. You can think of the launchpad as an onboarding to-do list. GoHighLevel gives you some direction on where to start with these items according to this setup guide here, but don't feel pressure to\nfollow this item by item. I'll walk you through the major\nfunctionality of the system, and you can revisit these\nlaunchpad lists afterwards. Before we continue, these are the other credit\nopportunities that I mentioned. If you wanna join the kickoff call here, that will earn you $15. Over the course of this video, we will get 25 for completing at least one of these launchpad tasks. And then, there's a $50 credit\nincentive to start your plan and join the implementation call. In the top left, you'll see Metics Media\nas my business name. If we click here, this is\nwhat's called a sub-account. You can think of a\nsub-account in GoHighLevel, like a separate profile on\nNetflix or a streaming service, and you can have up to three sub-accounts on the $97-a-month plan. One could be for your\nbusiness, like I have here, and we'll cover that today, and the other two could be\nfor other businesses you run or for helping clients\nmanage their businesses. Each sub-account has its own dashboard, contacts, and campaigns completely separate from the others. If you click here to switch to agency view and then Sub-Accounts on the left, this button right here is how you could create additional ones. For today, let's continue to focus on the primary sub-account that we're using for your business. To do that, click here to switch, and then back to whatever\nyour business is called. Once you're set up, the main dashboard here on the left will give you a quick\noverview of your business. I'll zoom out briefly so\nthat we can see everything. In the top right, you'll\nbe able to change the dates for the dashboard with this date picker, or you can add dashboards with\nthis button on the top left, if you upgrade to a different plan. The default dashboard\nwill give you visibility into your opportunities, your funnels. If we scroll down, you'll see your tasks, and even Google Analytics and Google Ads, if you're using those things. Obviously, the dashboard's\npretty empty now, so I'll return to show you\nwhat this might look like when we have some\nopportunity data entered. Before we get into\nconversations or calendars, let's start with contacts. Contacts are the heart\nof GoHighLevel's CRM. Everything else, from emails and calls to deals and payments, connect back here. If you've used a CRM like HubSpot or plan to import contacts\nfrom a similar tool, this will feel familiar. This view within the Contacts tab is where you'll manage all your leads and customer information. To add a single new contact, click on this plus icon in the top left, then fill in your fields for\nyour contact's information. If we scroll down for the contact type, you can choose lead or\ncustomer, choose a time zone, and then at the bottom you have settings to mark the communication\nchannels do not disturb, if you'd like. Then, I'll click Save. That will open this contact view. On the left, we have our\nfields for our contacts. We can toggle the empty ones like this. We also have company\ndetails in this tab here. We don't have any companies yet, so I can click here and add. And we can call this Dan's Podcast Agency just as a test company. In the centre of our contact form, you can see that we can\nsend an SMS, WhatsApp, or email directly to our customer, so whenever you're viewing\na specific contact, you can always reach out\ndirectly from the contact record. And then on the right hand side, we're gonna see most of the functionality that you would typically see with a CRM. So here we have an activity feed. We can add tasks for this contact, notes. We can see if they have\nany appointments here. We have documents,\npayments, and associations. All pretty empty for\nthe moment, obviously, but you can see how having\nall of these together associated in one place will be helpful when dealing with customers and leads. Instead of importing all\nof our contacts one by one, you'll likely need to import\na list from time to time. That's helpful if you're\ncoming from another system or if you wanna add a new list of leads. To import a list of contacts, let's come to Smart Lists at the top. Here is our test user that\nwe just added manually. To import, come over here and find this button, Import Contacts. You can import opportunities as well, but let's start with contacts. And come down here, and click Next. GoHighLevel provides a\nsample file to download, which is super helpful to\norganising your information. Let's take a look at that, and put it in our Downloads folder. Let's open up that CSV to\nsee how it's structured. On the far left, we have\nphone number, email, first and last name,\nbusiness name, a source, and then columns for additional\nemails, phone numbers, notes, and tags. And you'll notice in any field where we have multiple values, those values are separated by a comma. You can see that here\nin Tags, Phone Numbers, and Additional Emails. Let's close this. Click here to upload your file, and I'm gonna select one\nthat I prepared earlier. It's a file with some additional data that I added to the sample\nfile we just took a look at. Click Open, and in this\ndropdown you can choose between whether you wanna create contacts, whether you wanna create and update, or if you just wanna\nupdate existing contacts. I'll keep create and\nupdate, and click Next. After we upload, then you'll\nneed to map columns to fields. GoHighLevel will give you\na little mapping guide here that shows you what fields are required, and at the bottom we have our mapping, but if you used the sample file, everything should line\nup really nicely here. You'll have the preview information and if you need to change a\nfield, you can do so here. I'm gonna go ahead and click Next. And then, before we can\nstart the bulk import, you just need to check this box to confirm that you've sourced\nthese contacts correctly. Then, I'll start the import, and this is a pretty short list, so I'm just going to hit refresh, and this import is taking a\nlittle longer than normal. If you wanna check on the import, you can come to Bulk Actions and we can see that this\nhasn't started processing yet. I'll give it another minute or\ntwo and give this a refresh. Great. After a few minutes, our\nqueued import has finished. Now, that we've added some\ncontacts to work with, let's look at how you'll\nactually communicate with them and keep everything organised. The Conversations tab\nis your all-in-one inbox where emails, texts, calls, and web chats can all be managed together. The layout you see here is\njust like a traditional inbox, and let's look at two of the cool features you have access to when sending emails. The first is trigger links\nand the second is snippets. Let's see how we can use\nthem together in an example to better send emails. First, click on Trigger Links. When we use trigger links and our customers click on them, we can trigger events or in this basic use case, we can just see how often\nthe links are opened compared to when they're not. At my media company, for example, I've just imported a list of contacts that we're potentially interested\nin podcast sponsorships. Let's create an email that I\ncan send to those interested, and inside that email there will be a link for pricing information. When I use a trigger\nlink to show the pricing, I'll be able to see how many people clicked on the link\nfrom within that email. So let's go up here to Add Link. I'll call this Podcast Pricing Info. And for the link URL, you could link to the pricing page on any one of your service websites, but I'll just use an example site here, and click Save. So that creates our trigger. Now, let's add that trigger link that we just created within a snippet. A snippet is a reusable block of text, so if we make a snippet\nto use that trigger link, we'll be able to quickly\nsend an email follow up to anyone who expresses interest in sponsoring our episodes. Go up here to the Snippets tab, then click Add Snippet, Add Email Snippet. I'll name this snippet\nPodcast Pricing Info. For the subject, I'll fill in, \"Still Interested in Sponsoring?\" And then in the body I want\nto add the contact name as a custom value. So click Custom Values,\nContact, Full Name, and this will populate the contact name when we create this snippet. Then, I'll fill in the rest of the email, and here I want to insert the trigger link that we just created. So I'll go here to trigger links, and click Podcast Pricing Info, and that will insert the trigger link. Then, when I'm happy, I'll scroll down and click Save. And if we refresh, we can see the snippet\nthat I just created. Now, let's actually send this\nsnippet to my test contact so that I can show what it looks like, and then we can test the trigger link. Go back to Conversations, and click here to create a new message. Create a direct message, and I'll enter my test user down here. Click Continue. I'll select Email, and then this button here\nwill insert a snippet. This Podcast Pricing Info is\nthe snippet we just created, and just like that our\nemail is ready to go. And then, we'll be able to see if this recipient clicks on this link. I'll send this email now, and then I'll log in under this inbox, and click the link so\nthat we can analyse it. So I'll click Send. Now, I'll log into the email\ninbox that I use for test user, and we'll see what that email looks like. So here's the email. Still Interested in Sponsoring?\" If I open it, the contact\nname is filled in, and this is our link for the trigger. So if I open this in a new tab, this should bring us to Google because that was our test URL. Lemme close this. I'll close my inbox. And then in Conversations we want to go to the dropdown under Trigger\nLinks and click Analyse. And here, we can see that\nthat click was registered. If I scroll down, this was our link, and that's the click. So over time, if you're sending a lot of these sponsorship inquiries out, this will give you a good idea if people are actually clicking to view your rates. Now, that we've covered some functionality in the Conversations tab, let's look at scheduling\nfor your business. GoHighLevel includes a\nbuilt-in calendar tool over here on the left, so you can schedule appointments and connect directly with\nclients from this Calendars tab. First, we're gonna need\nto set up a calendar, as we don't have one yet. So let's go to Calendar Settings and then click Create Calendar. Here, you'll see all the\ndifferent types of calendars, and we can even expand this to see others, but in most cases you'll want at least one personal booking calendar. So I'll click this. And in order to create a calendar, we'll need to select a team member, which we don't have yet in the system. So if I click this dropdown, we don't have anything here, and we won't be able to save. So let me show you how\nto add a team member. I'll click this, and there's a couple things we can do. If you wanna set up a scheduling\nlink for a team member who will handle these calls, you can come over to my\nstaff under settings, and you can go ahead and add a user with this button here. However, if you want the\ncalendar to work for yourself, for the user that you signed up with, up here, basically, we\nneed to take this user from the agency level, add them to the sub-account\nor your business, and once we do that, you'll be able to use\nyourself as the team member to create the calendar. This is a bit tricky, so let me show you how\nto do it step by step. Click here and then go to Agency View. Then, in the left hand navigation, we wanna come to the Settings. Once we're in Settings, click Team, and you can see that I'm the agency owner. Come over to the pencil\nicon and click Edit, and then navigate to Roles & Permissions. Under Add sub-accounts, click this dropdown and\nselect your business. Then, click Save. Now, that we've added\nourself to our business, let's click up here in the top left to switch back to our sub-account, and navigate back to Calendars, and once more go to Calendar Settings. Now, when we create a calendar and we select Personal Booking, we'll automatically be added as the team member here. So I'll give this calendar a name, and I can add a description if I'd like. You can change the custom URL down here. Then if I scroll down, you can set the duration for the meetings and the availability for the booking link. And then, you can click Confirm. Once you confirm, you'll be given a link for that booking and an embed code, if you wanna place this on a website. I'll preview the booking widget now. Here we have our name, the duration, and our description, and we can select a time on any day. And once your contact\nenters their details, they can schedule the meeting. Now, I'll close this, and we can close this as well, and then, GoHighLevel\nwill give you a few tips for using your calendar. Now that we've created the calendar, we're still in Settings. So let's go back and click Calendars. And if we scroll up, this is our meeting. You can also create an appointment\nlike any other calendar. If we just click and\ndrag over a time slot, it will automatically\nfill our team member, and then we can add our contact. Book Appointment, and our\nappointment is booked. You may also want to sync one\nof your existing calendars, for example, a Google or Outlook calendar. To do that, come up to Calendar\nSettings, then Connections, and then we want to add\na new connected calendar. Under Google Calendar, I'll click Connect. Then, I'll click the account that I would like to connect to, and allow lead connector permissions. And then, we'll give this\na minute or two to connect. If you see this error, don't\nworry, just click Reconnect. Then try once more for lead connector. And there we go. All set. Now, that it's connected, come over to my profile,\nand then scroll down. Under Calendar Configuration\nand Linked Calendar, click Add here. Then, you can select the calendar that we just integrated with, and click Save. That will process and then connect. And now, your GoHighLevel calendar and this Google calendar will be synced. Let's test it by opening\nour Google calendar. We can create an event called GoHighLevel Sync Test and save. And then, I will close this tab. We'll go back to exit\nSettings, then to Calendars. I'll scroll up. And we can give this\nCalendar view a refresh, and there's our sync. Next, let's go to the Opportunities tab where you can track deals\nthrough a pipeline view and see exactly where each lead stands in your sales process. To start tracking opportunities, let's first create a simple pipeline by clicking Create New Pipeline. That will bring us over\nto the Pipelines tab, and then we can click Create Pipeline. By default, we have a simple\nfour-stage pipeline here with stages New Lead, Contacted,\nProposal Sent, and Closed. You can add a stage by\nclicking here if you'd like. Stages can be reordered, and you can delete any\nthat you don't need. I'll keep these four default stages, and we can call this Sponsorships. I'll leave all of the stages checked so that they show up in reporting, and then I will click Create. Now, that you have a pipeline, you can assign opportunities\nto that pipeline. Click here to return to\nthe Opportunities tab. In the dropdown, we can\nsee the new pipeline, and you should see your\npipeline stages down below. Like, we did with contacts, let's briefly add one opportunity\nbefore we import several. Click here to add opportunity. Here you can select a contact. Choosing Bob will\npre-populate his information. I'll double check to make sure we're in the Sponsorships pipeline, and I want this stage to\nbe the first new lead. Let's give the opportunity a value, say $1,000, and the rest I'll leave as is. You might wanna add one\nof your tags as well. So we had sponsorship potential earlier. I'll add that. Then, I'll click Create. And then, we can close this, and we'll see our new\nlead in our pipeline. We can move this through the stages, and if you click and hold, you can see that we have closed lost, closed abandoned, and closed won down low. I'll bring this back to New Lead, and let's import several more. Go up to the Import button. You can import contacts\nand opportunities together, but for now I'll just add opportunities, and I'll continue here. Then, like we did with contacts, we can take a look at the sample file. Click here to download that, and if I pull that up we can see the types of information listed. Now, in this sample file, we can see a lot of contact information, and there's also existing opportunity IDs, which we don't have. So I've made a copy of this import CSV. And I've simplified it greatly to exclude some of the\ncontact information. Let's look at my copy. So here I'm gonna let HighLevel determine the opportunity ID. I'll keep the opportunity name, but, because I want to\nassociate these opportunities with the current contacts that\nexist in the system already with these emails, I needed to find these IDs. To do so, I opened up\nanother tab of GoHighLevel, went to my contacts list, and if I wanted to see Bob's for example, I could click on Bob, and this string of characters\nis the contact ID in the URL. This ends in MKP. If I close this, and come back to my import sheet, that's Bob's ID there. I've kept the emails and have specified our Sponsorships\npipeline in pipeline ID and new lead in stage ID. I've populated the lead values\nand kept the statuses open. Let's use this sheet now. Back in HighLevel, I'll click to upload and\nselect that new sheet. These are all new opportunities, so I'll click Create as opposed to Create and update or Update. Then I'll click Next, and then we wanna map our data, so we'll go through. And, remember we'll have\nmore columns in our sheet than we'll actually import. These look good. I'm gonna select Pipeline\nhere and Stage here. We scroll down. I'll skip this import, and then check Don't import\ndata in unmapped columns. Then, click Next. Here, on the verify step, we'll look at just the\nmapping that we've selected. I actually don't wanna\nimport this one either, so we can go back, and remove followers, double check one last time, and then start the import. And after a minute or two, it looks like these have come through. I don't see Opportunity 2, so let's refresh once more, and we can go to Bulk Actions, and see if there are any errors. I'll go Show Stats. As suspected, there is an\nerror for Opportunity 2. I'll click Error, and it looks like this was a duplicate. And if we check my file, that makes sense, as we already had a test\nopportunity for Bob. Let's go back and close this. In the future, you may want to allow multiple\nopportunities per contact. Let me show you that setting real quick. Come down to Settings and\nscroll down to Objects, and then Opportunities. Here's the setting that\nwill allow you to do that. In our case, we got an error because Bob is in the same pipeline. I'll check this for the\nfuture and click Save. Now, let's go back and\nin our Opportunities tab we can move a few of these\nthrough the pipeline. One thing that I mentioned\nshowing you earlier, if we come back up and go to Dashboard, I'll close this and zoom out. We'll start to see much\nmore useful information as our opportunities move\nthrough their deal stages. I'll zoom back in here, and next, let's go to Payments. GoHighLevel also lets you\nmanage payments, invoices, and transactions right\ninside the platform. Within payments, there are other\npowerful features built in, like the ability to create products. To get started with payments, you'll need to integrate at\nleast one payment gateway. Let's click on this now. Then, click to connect on one of these popular payment providers. For me, I'll use Square. Then, you can go ahead and\nconnect to Square Live Mode. This will open up Square\nso you can sign in, and then I'll continue\nsigning into my account. And similar to the calendar, LeadConnect will need\naccess to your account. I'll click Allow. And back in GoHighLevel Square\nMode will show as enabled. If you only have one payment integration, this will become your default. Now, that we have a\npayment gateway integrated, let me show you how to\ncreate some products. Come up here and choose Products. If you already have existing\nproducts, you can import, but let me show you how\nto create a new one. Click Create Product, and then fill out your\nproduct information. I'll keep this toggled on\nInclude in Online store, so that we have the\noption to pull our product into other GoHighLevel features later. For this first product, I'll enter the podcast episode sponsorship that we've been working with. If we enable product label, we can give this product a tag. I'll call this a new item, and maybe we want that to\nshow for the first month as we're just beginning\nto offer this sponsorship. Right now, we don't have\na product collection, so I'll choose nothing here, and then for product tax category, you'll want to consult\nyour local tax professional for setting these up correctly. If we scroll down, you can\nselect some product media. Here, we can upload a product banner. I'll click Upload and select the banner. And then insert, and then you can click here\nto jump down to pricing. You can change the type and the amount, and we can show this as a discount. This is also known as\nstrikethrough pricing. And then, we could add a variant. In this case, maybe it's a\nblock of episodes at a discount. If you have different\ncourses or physical items, variants become important. We can then add a search\nengine listing, if we'd like. I'll leave those blank for the moment. And then, you can add a product handle. And I'll click Save. Now, we can go back, and\nwe'll see our product here. Now, this shows as a\nphysical product type. It's not super clear how to change that, so let me show you. Click Edit. Then, scroll down all\nthe way to your price. Then, click here. Now, we can scroll down again. And under Shipping and Delivery, change this to a digital product. Then, click Save. If we go back to Products,\nproduct type is now changed. I'll enter a few more products, and then we'll look at\nsubscriptions and invoices. Now, that I have a few more products in, let's look at how we can\nset up a subscription. I've set this YouTube coaching\nproduct up differently. Let's open this and\nscroll down to the price. Here, under pricing type, I've changed this from a one-time price to a recurring price. You'll need to do this for any products you would like to use in subscriptions. Let's come up to the Subscriptions tab, and then click Add Subscription. Here you can add a customer. Let's choose Bob again. My YouTube coaching always\nstarts on the first of the month. And then I can select the product. Because my other products\nare only one-time purchases, you won't see them here, but we will see the YouTube coaching. Then, we can scroll down. If we had a card already on file for Bob, we could choose it here, or we could add a new card. Then, you can enter the details and save this card for the\nfuture, if you would like. Because this is a demo, I won't schedule, but this is where you would\ngo and complete the order. Let me click Cancel and Cancel again. Another popular use case in GoHighLevel is just the standard invoicing, and it might be more convenient\nto use invoicing here than say to do it in Square. I'll come up to the\nInvoices and Estimates tab. Then, I'll click New, New invoice. Up at the top we have an invoice title. I can select this, and give it a new name. I can then select a customer. And we can even link\nthis to an opportunity. So I'll click here, and then the opportunity dropdown will show any opportunity\nthat we had open for Alice. The invoice number,\nissue date, and due dates will be populated, but\nyou can change these, and then here, you can add the product. Here, this is for the\npodcast episode sponsorship. Alice wants to run several of these, and at the bottom you'll\nhave additional options. You can add terms and\nconditions for this invoice. You could charge late fees. You could include tipping. And you can add attachments. On the right, we'll have\nthe preview of our invoice. We could save it as a\ndraught, or we could send it. Again, because this is a demo, and I don't actually\nwanna send this invoice, I'll click Back. Depending on the use cases\nwithin your business, there are other areas of\nfunctionality within payments including documents and contracts, sending payment links, and setting up coupons. But now that we have an idea\nbehind the core functionality of the CRM and behind payments, let's take a look at\nmore exciting features that can help you scale\nand market your business. Let's start by clicking on\nthe newer AI Agents tab. With features that will\nhelp you handle tasks, like chatting and answering phone calls. Even if you run a business where you don't get a lot of inbound voice or you're not super excited about AI, I think there's a few quick\nthings to show off here that can help your business. I'm gonna collapse this sidebar, and under the Getting Started tab, we have guides for voice\nAI and conversation AI. Let's jump to the Conversation AI tab. And here we can make a bot that helps handle inbound messages. If nothing else, this might\nbe a way to handle inquiries you get outside of business hours. To start, click Create Bot, and here, you can choose\nbetween the guided form set up, which is good if you're just starting out, or the prompt-based bot. I'll start with a guided form setup, and click Create New Bot. And we have a few different types. This is the general Q&A one, which might be helpful\nfor me for handling FAQs. And if we scroll down, we also have one for appointment booking. I'll continue with this\ngeneral Q&A and click Continue. On this screen, we'll\nadd basic brand info. If you scroll down, you can\nchoose the tone of voice, and then you wanna add\nany additional information to help answer these prompts. I'm gonna take a moment\nand fill these in now. Once you've added your information, you can scroll down and click Save. Then, I'll click Next. On this screen, you get to modify the bots settings. I'll change the name. I'll keep it the primary bot. Under the Preferred Channels, I don't do much on social, so we'll just keep the live chat, and you can change the wait\ntime before responding. You can also customise\nthe bot's initial message. Then, click Next. And then, here we can\nconfigure the bot's goals. I wanna give this bot a light touch, and I don't necessarily need someone's phone number to start. Scroll down to the\nQuestions and Objectives. Let's add one, and for my use case, this might say something like, \"Ask the user how many podcast episodes\nthey want to sponsor.\" And we could add another, something like, \"Ask the user when they want\nto sponsor the podcast.\" I don't have fields on the\ncontact for these questions, so I'll leave these optional\nand blank for the moment, and then I want to receive\nan email notification, if the bot doesn't know the answer. I'll toggle this on, then click Specific\nUsers, and select myself. Then, I'll click Save. We can test it here, if we'd like, or we can turn it to autopilot. I'll save and close. If you wanna edit the bot, click the three dot menu, then click Edit. If we scroll down, you can\nalso go to the bot trial here. Using the trial is a great way to see if you have a any blind spots, or if you need to\ncontinue training the bot so that you can reach your goals. This is how you clear it, and I can cancel. So to recap, I'm keeping this bot\nset to live chat only, making it the primary bot so it handles any new messages and putting it on autopilot\nso it replies automatically. That means once we add the\nchat widget to the site, the bot will greet\nvisitors, collect details, and book calls on its own. We'll wire the widget up in this site section a bit later. For now, let's look at the knowledge base that will power its answers, and we can see one was\nautomatically created. I can click the three\ndot menu here, and Edit, and the knowledge base is\nused to help your bot learn. Here we can click Add Source and FAQ. You might already have\na good list of these, but if not, as your contacts\nstart asking questions, you can fill them in here to\nbulk up your knowledge base. Here's one that we frequently get, and I can add an answer. As we add FAQs, our bot will get more\naccurate and more helpful. I'll click Save. If you have a website\nwith lots of information, you might try out the web crawler or adding a table is coming soon. Let's click back here. If you really start to\nuse these AI agents, agent templates might be helpful to you. There's a marketplace of agent apps all specified for different niches. You can choose between\nvoice and conversation AIs, and see what types of things\nare on the marketplace, many of which are free, and then finally if we scroll up, let's go back, and then in Content AI, here's where we can track our costs. This is the text cost, and if we're using images, like we do with our product banners, we can see the cost for those as well. Let's expand the sidebar and now continue on to the Marketing tab. The Marketing tab has\na broad range of tools, and this is where you can\nschedule social media campaigns, create emails, and even set up\nyour own affiliate programmes. Under the social planner, you can connect all of\nyour social media accounts and you can publish posts across multiple accounts all at once. I often see brands struggling\nto produce enough content and utilising the Evergreen Queue Post and the Recurring Post are good features to help maintain a consistent schedule. When you're ready to start posting, you can click Schedule Now. From here, you'll be able\nto type out your content and select which account to post to. To connect your accounts, click here, then follow the prompts for any of the accounts\nyou would like to connect. I'll close this, and then go back. Another big set of\nfunctionality is within emails. We can see our email sending statistics. I'll show you how to set up campaigns. And we can create templates. GoHighLevel generates some sample data so we can see how the\nstatistics will look, and I like that they do this so that you can get a sense\nof what this could be. If you wanna remove the sample data, click here to clear it. To create an email campaign, we can click here, or we\ncan go to the Campaigns tab. Now, I'll show you how to\nsend a blank email campaign and how to send one from a template. Under Email Campaigns, go over here and click New, Blank. You can create your email\nin a few different ways. The Design Editor is\nprobably my favourite. If you're comfortable,\nuse the Code Editor. Or you can use the Plain Text Editor. We'll see the Design Editor in a second when we look at the template, so for the purposes of this tutorial, let's use the Plain Text\nEditor to create a test. And this is no frills, as promised. Up here we can change the campaign name. I'll say Podcast Sponsorship Test. Within the editor, we can preview, obviously, this is very simple. And if we go back, we can send or schedule. Here, we can attach\nfiles, we can send now, or we have other options. In the Sender, I'll put my email address. If you're doing this for the first time, and you have an unverified address, you'll need to verify it. To do so, click here, and then look for the\nverification code in your inbox, and enter it. Then click Verify. You can add a sender\nname and a subject line. If we scroll down, we can enter\npreview text, if we'd like, and then we have multiple options for choosing the recipients that we wish to send this email to. Could choose contacts here\nby clicking the Add button. Then, we can search or just select. In our case, we might\nwanna choose from tags so I can select this and then add, and we had that sponsored potential tag. It will show you how many\ncontacts have that tag so you know how many people\nyou're sending this to, and then down below we\nhave multiple options to track clicks, set up\nUTM tracking, to add tags, and to resend the email if unopened. When you're ready, you\ncan preview in the browser or you can send a test. For now, I'll close\nthis and just hit Save. Then, I'll come back to the email builder, and back again. So this is our new blank\ncampaign that we just created. In the three dot menu, you'll see a few more options: to preview, to move,\nclone, archive, or delete because I saved this as a draught, all we need to do is open it, and you're ready to send or schedule. Next, let's look at how to\ncreate one from a template. So click the New button. Then, email marketing templates. On the left in the template library, we can search, and I'll choose\nthis one for advertising. GoHighLevel will set up your template. And here, we are in the editor. As you can see, we have many more options to drag and drop things here. This isn't a tutorial on how\nto edit this campaign template, but we have many more options to edit this than when we were just\nworking with the plain text. I'll rename this Podcast\nSponsorship Test 2 and save. Then, I'll go back and back again. If you wanna see the\ntemplates that you've created, go to this Templates tab, and they'll show up down here. This was the advertising\ntemplate we just looked at, and this one was created automatically when we sent that invoice. And then I'll return. If we come back to Campaigns. Workflow campaigns are\nalso pretty powerful. We'll look at those in a few minutes. If you click Create Campaign here, you actually go to the Automation tab, so that's where we'll pick back up. Before we leave the Marketing tab, we've already looked at snippets, so this was the Podcast\nPricing Info snippet we added earlier, and we've looked at trigger links. So we'll find the link that\nwe created earlier here. We also have an affiliate manager, so I'll click here to go to the dashboard. Affiliate programmes can be\na pain to set up and manage, but they're also a great\npotential marketing channel. You need to track referrals,\npayouts, and who referred who, but GoHighLevel's Affiliate\nmanager makes it simple. You can do it all from one dashboard, instead of relying on yet\nanother external tool. Clicking Learn More is proof that affiliate marketing\ncan get kind of complicated, but here, GoHighLevel\nkeeps it approachable. To get started, click Start\nYour First Affiliate Campaign, connect a payment gateway, and GoHighLevel will walk\nyou through the setup. We won't cover this full\nfunctionality today in detail, but it's good to know that it's here. Finally, under Marketing, one thing that you might\nutilise are brand boards. Here we have design kits and brand voices. The design kit is pretty simple. If you click Add Design Kit, it's basically a place for\nyour logo, your colours, and your visual brand, and if you're starting\na brand from scratch, you can choose one of these templates. I'll click Lagoon and then click Continue, and here you would replace your logos. You can edit your colours here. By clicking on a colour,\nyou can access the hex code. And you also have your typography. If you don't change anything here, you won't see this button enabled, but it's automatically\nsaved, if we go back. Under Brand Voice, you'll see what we worked on earlier, so if I come to the three dot menu and click Edit, and I scroll down, this is what we worked\non with our AI agent. Let's go back. And now, let's revisit the\nemail campaigns for workflows, so I'll click Emails, then Campaigns and then Workflow Campaigns. If you wanna automate\nsome of the marketing for your business, you can create these\nworkflows to automate tasks from within the automation tab. Here, specifically, these will\nautomate an email sequence. So you can click Campaign here, and it will open a new tab. That brings us to Automation. I'll close this just to show you that going to Automation\nbrings us to the same spot. Workflows operate like this. If this happens, do this. And GoHighLevel gives\nus a bunch of examples. If a customer booked an appointment, send them an email. Based on a call status, add a contact tag. We could create a workflow from\nscratch or from a template, but I wanna look at the\nemail drip sequence. The use case they have: \"Add contacts to this workflow to drip them a series of emails over time. This recipe uses the\n'Emailed Opened' condition to resend each email with a new subject, if it wasn't opened within 24 hours!\" This is a popular use case, and you could easily\nsee how this might apply to the podcast sponsorship email. Maybe our contact doesn't open or interact with that first email, in which case we may wanna\nsend them a second one, potentially even with a discount. Let's open the email drip sequence to see what the workflow builder looks like. Up top, we have a workflow name. And here we are in the Builder tab. If we scroll up, we can add\na trigger for some workflows. This can help us control when the contact gets added to the workflow. In this example, it will\nstart with the email. Click this node, and then\nyou can see the configuration to edit on the right. If you click the Learn More button, you'll be able to interact\nwith the workflow AI, which can help you set up your workflows. I'll keep this toggled off for now. Over here, we can see our subject. We can pick a template. So maybe it's that advertising\ntemplate we used earlier, and we can add test emails. I'll close this and cancel. In the next node, we\nhave a wait condition, which will hold a contact\nfor a specific time until the condition exists or the contact replies. It waits for the email in step one, looks for the email to be opened. We have other email events\nwe could select here, and then you can set the timeout duration. I'll cancel this, and then if we scroll down, we check if the email was opened. And this condition fork will\nbreak into two branches, the Yes branch and the No branch. If we click here, we can see other scenario\nrecipes for this branch. I'll click off and click Cancel here, but we can see how this works, branching into separate nodes. If the email's opened, we\nwait a day and send Email 2. If not, we send Email\n1 with the new subject, and if we scroll down we can\nsee the rest of the tree. Eventually, we check to\nsee if Email 2 is opened, and fork again. Under each no condition,\nwhen we send a second email with a new subject, we eventually end up linking to Email 3. And finally one more\nsend it in the sequence until we get to Email 4. At any point in the\nworkflow you can add a note by clicking the + button, and then you can search for\na new action here or here. And when you're ready to start testing, you can select test workflow, and you can select a contact. I'll choose myself, and Run Test. Obviously, the email sequences\ncan get pretty complex. Let's go back to Workflows. We can also use Build Using AI. I'll try entering a prompt. I want to send a contact my\nadvertising email template, then, wait a day, and then, I wanna send it to them again with a new subject line, if they haven't opened it. Then, I'll click build Workflow. GoHighLevel will show you\nworking through the steps here, and when it finishes, it will load the builder\nwith workflow AI opened. So we can scroll up. Here is a new contact\ncreated as a trigger, so we may need to edit this. Then, we'll send the\ninitial advertising email. Then, we'll wait the day. and then, we branch off\ninto our multiple paths. When the email hasn't been\nopened after the timeout, then we resend this advertising\nemail with the new subject. I find the AI workflows\naren't always perfect, but if this is new to\nyou, like it was for me, this can be helpful to just get\nsome nodes down as a draught. We can open this. It's already filled in a subject. We can select the template and save. If we go to our trigger,\nhere we have contact created. We can add a filter, so maybe Has Tag, Equals\nto, Sponsor Potential. That way this workflow isn't triggered every time a contact is created, only when the contact is created and has the Sponsor Potential tag added. In this type of node, you could keep adding filters to select the contacts you\nwant, and then I could save. Workflows can be overwhelming at first. Just know there's a lot of\npotential here in email marketing and with other tasks as well. I'll go back to Workflows and briefly show you the\nGlobal Workflow Settings, which is helpful if you\nwanna pause a workflow for a certain amount of time, and I'll exit settings here. Moving now to the Sites tab, GoHighLevel provides you the tools to build your online\npresence with websites, funnels and more, and online presence isn't limited to your web properties. It also includes other\ntouchpoints you may have with your contacts, like when you ask them to fill out a form or\nparticipate in a survey. Let's start by looking at\nsome of the functionality here that you might use most often. Funnels in HighLevel let you build step-by-step\npaths designed to convert. Each funnel is made of\nsteps, like a landing page, a checkout page, and a thank you page. In my example, if I were selling Metics Media\npodcast sponsorships slots, I could guide a potential sponsor from learning about the\nbenefits, to booking a spot, and then to a thank you\npage in a few steps. To create a funnel, click New Funnel. I find the fastest way to get up and running is to create\na funnel from templates. And, continue. On the left, you can search for templates. I'll try media. And this looks fairly sleek and modern. Choose template, and GoHighLevel\nwill add the template. Now, if we take a look, this\nis still fairly generic, but I think it gives a good skeleton, and we can replace the content. Up here, you'll have an\noption to connect a domain. Here is our URL to preview. I'll close this tab. You have all of your standard tools here. You can add elements from here, and when you click elements, your properties will be\non the right hand side. I'll close this, and up here you can save or publish. I'll save this, and then I'll go back. Here, we can see the steps\nthat were created for us, and we can add new steps\nor import them if we want. At each step, we can add a product. This will pull from your product list you. You can choose a price and save. If we go back and click New Funnel again, you can start from blank when you're feeling more comfortable, or you can also try Funnel AI. If you continue, you have a few of these\nfunnel generations for free. You just enter your business name, select an industry, click Next. Then, you can fill out this short prompt, and then generate. Once it's done, it will\nautomatically open, and that's just one more way that you can generate a starting point. I'll save this and then return. Coming over to Websites, they will give you more room to showcase your products or services as compared to a funnel. They have menus, multiple pages, and freedom for visitors to explore rather than be guided step-by-step. Click here to create a new website, and you can start from blank again, or the fastest way to get up and running is to choose a template. Then, I'll click Continue. I'll search media again and choose one. Your template will be added. It will open up, and we'll see the same\nintuitive builder interface that we saw on the funnel builder. Here, you can change the page. You can toggle the mobile\nand desktop view here. The properties for each\nelement are found on the right, and you can still preview,\nconnect the domain, save or, publish. I'll click Save, and then back. And in this view, we can see that the pages\nare broken out individually. Click back once more to get to your full website list. In stores, you can also\nbuild an online store to sell your products. Unlike a regular website, a store adds e-commerce\ntools like product pages, inventory, and checkout. If you didn't use GoHighLevel, you might want Shopify\nfor something like this, but here it's built right in, and you have a guide to\nwalk you through the steps. If you have followed along so far, you might have things like Add Products and Set Up Payment provider\nalready checked off, and you can continue working through this guide to get set up. I'll close it. When you're ready, you can click new store. Like, funnels and websites. You can choose a template and continue. I'll choose this one. And GoHighLevel will\nadd the template for us. If we scroll down on this page, we should find an element\ncalled Product List. That's right here. Now, if we preview this store, and scroll down to that product list, you'll see the products that we have already entered in GoHighLevel. I'll close this, then click Save. I'll click back, and you can get a sense of how quickly you could launch a fully featured store. We have a lot of tools\nunder the Sites tab here, and I can't cover them all in this video, but the blog tool makes\nit very simple to manage and oversee posts for your business. Click Create Blog Site, and you can enter a site title, a domain and slug and a description. Or if we go back, and you choose this dropdown here, again, we can get set up pretty quickly by creating a blog from a template. I'll select one, and this will quickly\nadd several blog posts. And you can edit this content right away. Here we can open one, and we're right back to this blog editor. I'll click back. When you're ready to publish it, you can click on the three dot menu, and then Settings, and then you can give it a domain. If you don't have any domains added, click the settings gear, and here you can purchase\nor just connect the domain. I'll go back. And if you prefer WordPress, GoHighLevel lets you host it\ndirectly inside the platform. That means that you don't need\na separate hosting provider. You can consolidate\neverything in one place. This might be a good fit for\nyou if you're already familiar with using WordPress or if\nyou have a WordPress site. I'll link a WordPress tutorial that I've done in the description, if you wanna learn more\nand pursue that later. If you wanna use HighLevel's hosting, click here to activate WordPress. Then, you can decide whether\nto charge the sub-account, or if you'd like to charge the agency, and then you can subscribe here. Finally, you can add a chat\nwidget to any site or funnel. Any messages come right back\ninto your conversations inbox so you can respond quickly\nwithout juggling multiple tools. Click New, and then select the type of chat. I'll choose All-In-One. In the top right, you notice that Get Code\nand Save are not clickable. HighLevel tells us \"The agency\nwebsite URL cannot be blank.\" If you see this message, before you start, you\nneed to enter something for your agency website URL. To do that, click back, and let's leave. We haven't done anything yet. Then, click here to switch to Agency view. Then, go to Settings. Click on the company tab in the left, and enter a company website. Once I do that, I'll scroll\ndown and click Save Changes. Then, we can return to\nour sub-account up top. Then back to Sites, over to Chat Widget, and we can start over by editing\nthe chat widget we started. On the left, you have\nsome styling options. You can scroll down and customise\nyour widget using these. There's also a widget\ncustomization section. In the middle, you can\nconfigure the chat window with the content that will be shown, and you have some control\nover the messaging. So you can see things, like the live chat\nacknowledgements and more. Now, when you're done,\nyou can click Get Code, and you can copy this script\nto use on other sites. I'll close this, and I'll show you how you can use this on one of your HighLevel websites. Let's go back, click Websites, then click on a site to open it. Go to Settings, scroll down, and here you can enable the chat widget. Then, I'll save. If we preview from the homepage, we should see the chat\nwidget in the bottom right as we head configured it. I'll close this. If you offer courses or paid content, the memberships feature lets you set up a designated members area right inside GoHighLevel. All of this content is delivered\nthrough the client portal, a secure branded login area where your customers can access\ntheir courses, communities, and any other membership\ncontent you give them. To see what the portal looks like, make sure you're on the dashboard, and then you can click on\nthis client portal URL. Before you customise it, this is what users will\nsee when they get there. I'll close this, and if we scroll down on the dashboard, we have several different actions that we can use to invite users. You can generate a magic link, invite them to the portal or send a log in email. Contacts will also receive an email, if they purchase an offer, and within that email there\nwill be a link to join. If we scroll back up, we can come up here and click Settings, and this is where you can\nconfigure your client portal. You can set up your domain,\npick your chat widget. Here, we can open branding. This is that blue colour\nwe just saw on the preview. We can add logos, support. And then if we go back, we\nalso have Email Settings. The one that I was just talking about, the email that goes out for course buyers, that's this: Offer Access Email. And we can take a peek and\nsee what that looks like. I'll close this and go\nback to the dashboard. Now, that we've looked at\nthe client portal itself, you'll need something for your members to actually access once they're inside. That's where products come in. So I'll go to courses and click Products. Let's start by creating a test course, and then we'll package\nthat course into an offer. I'll click Create Product. You can import from\nKajabi, if you're familiar, and have courses there, but\nI'll start from scratch. And then we have a couple\npre-configured options. The Sprint Course is very short. The Marathon has a little bit more. You can choose a membership or you can build your own from scratch. Let's select a sprint course\nhere, for the example. And I'll call this\nYouTube ranking academy. Let's suppose I have some contacts that want to scale up\nin YouTube themselves. Here, I'll click Create Product. If you had started from scratch, you would have to make all\nof these lessons yourself, but by clicking the Sprint Course, you have some skeleton\nthat's already built out. If you click this button,\nyou can add lessons, subcategories, assessments,\nand credentials. So you can still customise this. Here, we'll notice a notification about your payment processor. Until you hook this up, you can only have free products here. If we click this button, we can preview the course in a new tab. I'll close this. At any time, we can preview\nan individual lesson. And we can see how this lesson\nlooks within the player. I'll close this. With the pencil icon. We can edit a lesson. You can upload video,\naudio, configure your title, description, add a video\nthumbnail, add a lesson thumbnail. When you've made changes,\nyou can click Save. I'll go back for the moment. In the top here, we can\nenter product details. You can edit the title, add a description, add a product thumbnail. You have a few customization options. This is the default theme, but you can browse some of them here. Not a huge selection, but you do have some\noptions that change it up. Offers, we'll cover in just a second, and then you also have a place where you can manage comments. And if you go back, there's\nalso a section for credentials. You can click the three\ndot menu and say Preview. This will show you the certificate that people get upon completion. Lemme close this, and\nnow let's look at offers, which you can find under Courses. Now, that we have a\ncourse added as a product, the next step is to create this offer. This is where you decide how people will actually get access, whether it's a one-time\npayment, a subscription, or if you're bundling\nthis product with others. In the top right click Create Offer. I'll give this a title. Then, I'll select which products\nto include in this offer. YouTube Rankin Academy\nis the one we just added. For Type, again, until I\nadd that payment processor, free is the only type we can have, and you can add a price text\noverride, if you'd like. Then I'll create the offer. You can see that we're\ncurrently in draught mode here. This is our title, our\ndescription, and our price. I'll set this to Published,\nand then I'll save. We can check out Upsell, where we would add additional offers, and then we can get a link to the offer. I'll copy this, and we can also preview it right here in this tab. I'll close this. Go back to details. You can also edit the checkout, so I'll click here, and there are a few more\nthings you can configure. You can add a banner image here,\nposter image, a logo image. You can collect some contact information. Maybe you want their phone number. If we go back, you can also configure\na service agreement. Once your offers are set, you can go beyond just selling courses by creating a community. Communities let you build groups where your students can connect, ask questions, and share progress. This adds a social layer,\na social value on top of the content that you're selling. Here, scroll down and\nclick Create a Community. You can fill in the details. I'll provide a group name. You can edit the group URL,\nadd a brief description, and then you can set if this\ngroup is discoverable or not. I want this to be private. Down low, you can add some\nbranding elements, if you'd like, and then click Create group. That will open the client hub, and if it's the first time you're joining, you'll be prompted to\nupload a profile picture. Here, you can invite members. You can copy the group\nlink or invite by email. I'll close this and close the community. If I open a new tab and paste that link, this is the signup screen that someone will be welcomed with. I'll close this. Down low, we can see our group. We can change the status here and make it inactive at\nany time if we would like, and we can change the owner. Finally, within the memberships\ntab, you have Credentials. And here we can see a certificate for YouTube Ranking Academy. So this was created\nwhen we had our course. And much like the sites, and\nfunnels, and email builders, we can edit all of these elements to create our certificates. I'll go back. You can also explore the\nGokollab Marketplace. If community features are really\nimportant to your business. Now, let's switch gears and\ntake a look at media storage where all of your files and\ncreative assets are managed. Under media storage, you can manage the\nfiles, images, and videos that you'll use across your\nwebsites and campaigns. There are some image generation\nfeatures here as well built right in. We can see that our files have been added. If I go to the My Media dropdown, we have tools for background images. You're able to get images from Unsplash. I could search for media advertising. And you also have the\noption to use Pixabay. You can obviously upload\nyour own images here. You can connect to Drive. If I go back to my media, and I clear the search, our brand board has been saved here, and our AI content has\nbeen saved here as well. These are the generations\nthat I created earlier. If you wanna create a new\ngeneration, you can click here, you can add a prompt, choose\nthe number of variations, and choose a style. As a refresher, if you need to track the\ncost of your AI generations. That's under AI Agents, Content AI, and the Image tab. And here you can see those images and the cost for the generations. Another key part of growing your business is building trust, and GoHighLevel has a\nfull reputation system built right in for managing reviews. In the Reputation tab, the top shows an overview, and you have onboarding steps. And you'll first wanna connect\nyour Google business profile. At the bottom, you'll see your stats, and when you're ready, you\ncan send a review request. Here, I'll choose a contact. Let's do Bob. And I wanna check email\nhere as one of the modes, but we need to enable email requests. Click here, and then toggle this button. Once you toggle that on, the default email will be set. Here, you can click the three dot menu, and Preview & Edit. So here we can review. You can change the name and\nsubject and then click Save, or you can use an entirely\nnew template by clicking here. Now, you can customise\nthis more to your liking, but I'll cancel for now, and I'll make sure that I\nclick my default email here. Then, come back to Overview, and we'll start the request again. I'll select Bob. Now, we can check email as a mode, and our template is selected. Then, I can send that review request. Then, you can refresh, and you'll see that invite. When that review comes\nin, you'll see it here. If you go to the Requests tab, you can see what we just sent. And when Bob responds to the request, that will show here in Reviews. And on the Widgets tab, you can create a section\nto embed on your website. If we go over to the\nTemplates tab on the right, you can pick one of these styles. Then, you can edit the\nwidget if you'd like. And then, when you're ready to copy this and embed it to your site, then you can come up here and click this button to\nreview the widget code. This link will show you how to use the review widget\non your website or funnel. I'll close this and this. Finally, let's take a quick look at how the settings are\norganised in GoHighLevel and where you can configure your account, business services, and other preferences. We have settings in two places. So first, if we go up here\nand switch to Agency view, Agency Settings will be\ndown in the bottom left. We'll use the agency settings for things that affect the whole agency,\nlike billing, branding, or client accounts, and then we can also get to the settings within the sub-account. So I'll click here to switch, open the sub-account, and we can navigate to\nthe sub-account settings. We'll use the sub-account\nsettings for the tools of each client of our main\nbusiness, like calendars, pipelines, and domains. We can see things here like our profiles, our billing, and settings for\nall the other functionality, but after you start to get\nfamiliar with GoHighLevel, many people want to invite a user. Within the sub-account, to\ndo that, click My Staff. Then, in the top right click Add User. You can give the user\na name, and an email, and other details like a phone, and a profile picture, if you'd like. Then, I'll click Next. You can select a user role. I don't want this person to be an admin, so I'll change it to user. And then you can further\nrestrict this user's visibility and control all of their roles and permissions individually. When you're happy, click Save, and GoHighLevel will send\nthis user an invite email. So that adds a user\nwithin your sub-account. To do this at the agency level, simply come up here,\nswitch to Agency view, then the Agency Settings, and here you'll want to go to Team. You'll see yourself as the agency owner, the new user that we just\nadded as an account user, and you can add another. Another popular thing that people wanna do is add a custom field. That way they can track something\nunique to their contacts. Maybe that's a field for\ntheir primary YouTube channel. Maybe that's a field for\ntheir primary podcast. Once that custom field is created, it will show up across the\ncontact forms for that business. This is done at the sub-account level, so let's navigate to the top left and choose our sub-account. Go back to the sub-account settings. Then, I'll scroll down\nand select Custom Fields. In the top right, I'll add a field, and here you can choose through\nall the custom field types. In my case, I'll just choose\na single line text input, and then I'll click Next, and I'll give it a name. Here, I'll call this Primary Podcast, in case our contacts also have a podcast. I'll keep this on the Contact object, but you can do this for\nopportunities and companies as well. And then here I'll\nselect the Contact group. This is where on the form it will show up, and I don't want any placeholder or pre-fill values for the moment, so I'll click Save. Then, I'll exit settings\nby clicking go back, I'll go to Contacts, I'll find Bob, and if we scroll down, we\ncan see the earlier field that I added, Primary YouTube Channel, and this is the new one that\nwe just added, Primary Podcast. and that's how you can customise contacts with fields of your own.
