This isn't drop shipping or another side hustle where you have to run paid ads or go viral to actually make it work. It's a real service that people will gladly pay for because it fixes something that they're genuinely struggling with and that's losing customers. If you've been searching for a real business idea that's simple to set up, provides real value, and doesn't need 10 years of experience to actually get it going, then this is something that you need to see. No coding, no paid ads, and no sales team to get this going. It's just a plug-and-play AI system that answers calls, qualifies leads, and it books appointments 24/7. If this is something that you would love to offer, then drop a comment that says AI setup down below. I will even send you a link that unlocks some amazing bonuses inside the software that we're going to use. It includes templates, automation, and step-by-step training without costing you anything more. In this video, I'm going to show you what this AI setup does, why businesses are excited for it, and how to set the whole thing up in just a few minutes, even if you've never done anything like this before. All right, let's dive in and I'll show you exactly how it works. So, we're going to be using a software called High Level. It's an amazing all-in-one automation and marketing software. Once you're inside, you're going to come into your sub account, come all the way down to AI agents, and then come up to Voice AI. Once you do that, you'll see a dashboard that looks like this, and I'm going to show you how to set up this AI agent in just three steps. So, you're going to come over to the right hand side, click on create agent, where you're going to give your agent a name. I will just call it plumber agent. Then, you write the business's name, select the language you want the AI to speak in, and then you can even choose the voice. In this case, I'll just leave it as Jessica. You can click this button to preview what it will sound like. Then just select your time zone and then click on next. In step two, we're going to define the agents goals. Because when businesses miss their calls, we don't want the AI to pick up the phone and just have a normal conversation asking them about their day. We wanted to actually do something and that is to book an appointment. So in this section, this is where we're going to select the knowledge base. If you do not have one created, just come to create new, click on create knowledge base, give it a name, give it a description, and then click on create. So this is where you can add a whole bunch of sources into your knowledge base. The knowledge base will then be used to train the personality of the bot so that it can sound and represent your business or the business that you're selling this AI agent to. So just click on add sources where you can let it webcraw a website. I click on that you just enter the URL, click extract data, then it will automatically scrape the entire website, pull in all the information and automatically configuring it into the knowledge base. Okay. So once you've created the knowledge base, come back to AI agents up to voice AI agent list and then back to the agent that you created. Then come up to agent goals and then select that knowledge base that you just created. Then you want to select the details that you want the AI agent to collect on the call. So if I wanted to collect the name and the email, just toggle on the options. And then just below that, we even have the option to trigger a workflow when call is completed. This means that if you want to do some advanced automation and automatically fire a different task after the call is complete, then you can just toggle this on, select the workflow, and then it will fire once the call has ended. I'm going to toggle it off for now. And then I'm going to come down here and click on save. Then we're going to come to the final step and that is to come up to phone and availability. This is where we're going to connect a phone number. It could be your own phone number or the phone number of the business that you're selling this to. But to do that, we need to buy a phone number to mask their number. So if you do not have one, all you have to do is click on buy new number. And once you do that, it should just be a dollar a month. And once you've done that, click on the toggle down and then select the number you've just purchased. This AI agent will cost just over 13 cents per minute to operate, but it's well worth it and can be charged onwards to your customer. Then the final toggle we want to turn on is this one over here, the enable AI agent as a backup to the phone number/n number poolool. What this means is that when somebody calls a business and that business does not pick up, maybe their receptionist was out or somebody just didn't get to the phone in time, the AI agent will then step in and handle that call. So make sure that's toggled on and then click on save. Right. So once we've set everything up, we want to now make sure that the agent is good by testing it. You can do that by adding your own phone number in over here and then clicking call me. You'll see you have 10 free minutes, so don't worry about it charging your credits. >> Hey, you have reached Katon Walker LLC. How can I help you today? >> Hey, I just want to test out the bot to see if the agent is working. >> Got it. Let's start with your name.
