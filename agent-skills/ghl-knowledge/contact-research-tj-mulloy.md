## The Mulloy Family & Achill-Cleveland Connection

### The Mulloy Siblings (from Stephen's obituary)

Stephen's siblings: Tony (deceased), Mary, Patrick (Mary), John, Michael (deceased), **Thomas (Maggie)**, Brendan (Marjorie), **T.J.**, and Anne Hodge (Tim)

**Note:** "Thomas (Maggie)" and "T.J." are listed separately — TJ may be a separate sibling from Thomas, or TJ could be a nickname for Thomas. Either way, it's a large Irish-American family deeply rooted in Cleveland.

### The Achill–Cleveland Twinning

- County Mayo and Cleveland have been sister cities since then
- The relationship was built on the historical migration of Achill islanders to Cleveland's "Angle" neighborhood (West Side, near West 25th Street)

- The Mayo Society of Greater Cleveland and Údarás na Gaeltachta became business partners through this connection
