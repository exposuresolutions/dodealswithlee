## TL;DR — Why This Matters for DDWL

Google's Gemini now powers:
- **Google Maps** (AI recommendations, "Know Before You Go")
- **Apple Siri** (multi-year partnership announced)
- **AI Overviews** in search results

This means **every smartphone on Earth** (Android + iPhone) now uses Gemini to recommend businesses. Businesses not optimized for AI search = invisible.

**This is a new revenue stream for Lee.** We already have GoHighLevel. We already have the prospecting tools. We just need to add AEO as a service.

## The Playbook (What Lee Should Do)

### Step 1: Build Lead Lists
- Use **Gemini AI prompts** to generate lists of local businesses by industry + location
- Target: small businesses making $500K - $2M/year
- Exclude franchises and national chains
- Focus on businesses with outdated websites, no chat widgets, poor reviews

**Sample Gemini Prompt:**
> "List 20 [industry] businesses in [city] with websites that appear outdated, have fewer than 50 Google reviews, and are not ranking in Google's AI overviews. Include business name, URL, owner name if available, and contact info."

### Step 2: Run Trust Audits
- Use **GoHighLevel's prospecting feature** (integrated with Google Maps)
- Generates overall digital presence score
- Mobile-friendly, shareable via link
- Highlights: missing chat widgets, poor review response, unclaimed Google Business profiles
- **We already have GHL — this is built in!**

### Step 3: Cold Outreach
**Email Template:**
> "Quick question — have you noticed Google showing AI answers above the search results lately? We're seeing businesses lose clicks even while still ranking well. I ran a quick check on your site, and it doesn't appear in the AI answers yet. Happy to send you a short screen recording showing what Google's AI is recommending instead. No pitch — or happy to send you an AI trust audit. Here's a link to the audit I created for you: [LINK]"

### Step 4: Close & Deliver
- Invoice through GHL's Stripe integration
- Deliver: Google Business Profile optimization, review management, AEO, SEO
- GHL has a **16-point optimization checklist** built in
- Ongoing monthly retainer (competitors always improving = recurring need)

### Step 5: Scale with AI
- AI-generated social media content via GHL marketing planner
- Automated review request campaigns
- AI chat widgets on client websites
- Voice AI for phone handling (we're already building this!)
