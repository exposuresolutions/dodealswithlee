To set up an IVR (Interactive Voice Response) workflow in GoHighLevel, follow these steps:

1. **Create a new workflow**: Go to **Automation** > **Workflows** and click on **New Workflow**.
2. **Add an IVR trigger**: In the workflow editor, click on **Add Trigger** and select **IVR**.
3. **Configure IVR settings**: Set up your IVR by selecting the **IVR Type** (e.g., Phone Call, Voicemail), **IVR Action** (e.g., Play Audio, Ask Question), and **Audio File**.
4. **Add conditions and actions**: Use **Conditions** to route calls based on user input (e.g., press 1 for sales, press 2 for support) and **Actions** to perform tasks (e.g., assign to agent, send email).
5. **Test and deploy**: Test your IVR workflow and deploy it to your phone numbers or channels.

Best practices for IVR workflows in GoHighLevel:

1. **Keep it simple**: Avoid complex IVR menus and focus on a simple, intuitive experience for your callers.
2. **Use clear audio files**: Ensure your audio files are clear, concise, and easy to understand.
3. **Set up fallbacks**: Configure fallback actions for unexpected user input or technical issues.
4. **Monitor and analyze**: Use GoHighLevel's analytics to monitor IVR performance and make data-driven decisions to optimize your workflows.
5. **Integrate with other tools**: Leverage GoHighLevel's integrations with other tools (e.g., CRM, email marketing) to create a seamless customer experience.

Menu paths and button names may vary depending on your GoHighLevel plan and configuration. Always refer to the official GoHighLevel documentation for the most up-to-date information.

**Old vs new way**: In older versions of GoHighLevel, IVR workflows were created using a separate IVR editor. As of 2026, IVR workflows are created using the unified workflow editor, which provides a more streamlined and intuitive experience.
