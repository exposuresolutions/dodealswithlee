Always refer to the official GoHighLevel documentation for the most up-to-date information.\n\n**Old vs new way**: In older versions of GoHighLevel, IVR workflows were created using a separate IVR editor. As of 2026, IVR workflows are created using the unified workflow editor, which provides a more streamlined and intuitive experience."
