# DDWL Logo Redesign — Kimi 2.5 Prompt

## PASTE THIS INTO KIMI (upload Option 1 and Option 2 images as reference)

---

I'm redesigning the logo for "Do Deals With Lee™" — a premium real estate investment education brand. I've uploaded 2 reference logos that the client loves (Option 1: Holographic Glow, Option 2: Classic Neon).

## Brand Context
- 7,000+ deals closed, $500M+ volume, Inc. 5000 recognized
- CEO Lee Kearney — Licensed Real Estate Broker, MBA, Tampa FL
- Getting a real neon sign fabricated for his podcast studio
- National brand with premium positioning

## What the Client Said
- **Lee**: "I just like the style and feel of 1 and 2. Would like to see some other variations first."
- **Krystle**: "On option 2, can the house be a different color? I think it needs to be a different color than the word DO."

## Logo Elements (MUST KEEP)
- "DO" text (top left)
- House icon with roofline and window (next to DO)
- "DEALS" large text (below)
- "WITH LEE" in a tag/badge (below DEALS)
- Stacked layout, reads top to bottom

## Brand Colors
- Cyan #00E5FF (primary — trust, modern energy)
- Orange #FF6B00 (secondary — action, Florida sun)
- Gold #FFD700 (accent — success, premium)
- Black #0A0A0A (background — luxury, authority)

## Generate 4 Variations

Please generate 4 logo images based on the uploaded references, keeping the same style and feel but with these specific color changes:

**VARIATION 1 — "Cyan House Neon"**
Option 2 (Classic Neon) style. Everything the same BUT the house icon is now CYAN (#00E5FF) instead of orange. "DO" stays orange, "DEALS" stays cyan, "WITH LEE" tag stays orange. True neon tube outlines on black background.

**VARIATION 2 — "Gold House Neon"**
Option 2 (Classic Neon) style. House icon is now GOLD (#FFD700). "DO" stays orange, "DEALS" stays cyan, "WITH LEE" tag is now gold to match the house. Warm/cool contrast. True neon tube outlines on black.

**VARIATION 3 — "Holographic Cyan House"**
Option 1 (Holographic Glow) style. House icon is pure cyan (#00E5FF) with a subtle orange glow around its edges. Text has the same cyan-to-gold gradient shift. Reflective floor effect. Premium iridescent feel.

**VARIATION 4 — "Gilded Zenith" (Your Best Shot)**
Combine the best of both styles. House icon in solid GOLD (#FFD700) with a thin cyan edge glow. "DO" in cyan with a subtle gold inner glow. "DEALS" in bold cyan with a thin gold outline. "WITH LEE" tag in black with gold text and a soft cyan aura behind it. Deep matte black background. This should look like a $10,000 logo — the kind you'd see on a billboard, embroidered on a black polo, AND as a real neon sign.

## Design Requirements
- Must be readable on a FOR SALE sign at 30 feet distance
- Must work as a 2-inch embroidered logo on a polo shirt
- Must work as an actual fabricated neon sign
- Must look premium on both dark AND light backgrounds
- Square format, high resolution
- No background text or watermarks — just the logo on black

## After the 4 logos, also generate:
1. The winning logo on a real estate FOR SALE yard sign (on a Florida lawn, sunny day, palm trees)
2. The winning logo on a highway billboard (black background, "7,000+ Deals Closed" tagline)
3. The winning logo on a black t-shirt where the neon colors FLOW through the fabric
4. The winning logo embroidered on a black snapback hat
5. The winning logo embroidered small on a black polo shirt (left chest)
6. The winning logo as a real neon sign on a dark brick wall (podcast studio setting)
