## Feedback from Lee & Krystle (Feb 17, 2026)
- **Both like Options 1 (Holographic Glow) and 2 (Classic Neon)**
- **Krystle**: "On option 2, can the house be a different color? It needs to be a different color than the word DO."
- **Lee**: "I just like the style and feel of 1 and 2. Would like to see some other variations first."

## Current Brand Colors
| Color | HEX | Role |
|-------|-----|------|
| Cyan | #00E5FF | Primary — energy, modern, tech-forward |
| Orange | #FF6B00 | Secondary — action, enthusiasm, Florida sun |
| Gold | #FFD700 | Accent — success, premium, wealth |
| Black | #0A0A0A | Background — luxury, authority |

## Color Psychology Research (Applied)
- **Cyan/Electric Blue** → Trust, stability, modern energy. Perfect for tech-forward real estate
- **Orange** → Enthusiasm, action, sunshine. Florida/sunbelt brand identity
- **Gold** → Exclusivity, success, heritage. Signals premium positioning
- **Black** → Luxury, sophistication, authority. High-end backdrop
- **Key insight**: The cyan + orange combo is DDWL's unique differentiator — no major RE brand uses this exact pairing

## Design Requirements
1. **Must work at distance** — billboards, for-sale/let signs on houses
2. **Must work small** — email signatures, letterhead, business cards
3. **Must work as neon sign** — Lee's podcast studio (getting one fabricated)
4. **Must work on merch** — NOT just logo on product, colors should FLOW through the design
5. **Must look good on dark AND light backgrounds**
6. **Professional yet bold** — stands out but not gimmicky

## What We Need Generated
### Round 1: Logo Variations (4 per AI engine = 16+ options)
Based on Options 1 & 2 style, with Krystle's fix (house ≠ DO color):

**Variation A**: Option 2 style (Classic Neon) — house in CYAN, "DO" stays orange
**Variation B**: Option 2 style (Classic Neon) — house in GOLD, "DO" stays orange  
**Variation C**: Option 1 style (Holographic Glow) — house in pure cyan, text gradient shifted
**Variation D**: Hybrid of 1 & 2 — neon tube outlines with holographic color shift

### Round 2: Application Mockups (for top 3 picks)
- **For Sale sign** — yard sign on a property lawn
- **For Rent sign** — similar treatment
- **Billboard** — highway billboard mockup
- **Merch: Hat** — snapback with logo flowing through design
- **Merch: T-shirt** — colors running through the fabric
- **Merch: Polo** — professional embroidered look
- **Business card** — front and back
- **Email signature** — inline logo
- **Neon sign** — mounted on wall (podcast studio)

### Round 3: Logo Reveal
- User will create CapCut video reveal for top picks
- Need: high-res transparent PNGs, dark/light versions, animated SVG concepts
