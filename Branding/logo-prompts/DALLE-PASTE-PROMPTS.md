## OPTION 2 STYLE (Neon Sign) — 3 Color Variations
Upload "DDWL - Neon Redraw.png" as reference for each.

### 2A: Cyan House (Krystle's fix)
Recreate this exact "DO DEALS WITH LEE" neon sign logo on black background. Keep everything the same EXCEPT change the house icon color from orange to bright CYAN (#00E5FF) so it matches "DEALS" instead of "DO". The house must be a clearly different color from the word "DO". Keep "DO" orange, "DEALS" cyan, "Wtac yITH LEE" tag orange. Same neon tube style, same layout, same reflective floor. Square format.

### 2B: Gold House
Recreate this exact "DO DEALS WITH LEE" neon sign logo on black background. Keep everything the same EXCEPT change the house icon color to rich GOLD (#FFD700). "DO" stays orange, "DEALS" stays cyan, "WITH LEE" tag stays orange. The gold house creates a warm premium accent between the orange and cyan. Same neon tube style, same layout, same reflective floor. Square format.

### 2C: White House
Recreate this exact "DO DEALS WITH LEE" neon sign logo on black background. Keep everything the same EXCEPT change the house icon color to bright WHITE neon. "DO" stays orange, "DEALS" stays cyan, "WITH LEE" tag stays orange. The white house stands out as a neutral anchor. Same neon tube style, same layout, same reflective floor. Square format.

Upload "DDWL - Holographic Gradient.png" as reference for each.

### 1A: Cyan House (instead of orange)
Recreate this exact "DO DEALS WITH LEE" holographic gradient logo on black background with reflective floor. Keep everything the same EXCEPT change the house icon from orange to bright CYAN (#00E5FF) so it matches the text gradient. Same holographic/iridescent text effect, same layout. Square format.

### 1B: Gold House
Recreate this exact "DO DEALS WITH LEE" holographic gradient logo on black background with reflective floor. Keep everything the same EXCEPT change the house icon from orange to rich GOLD (#FFD700). Same holographic/iridescent text effect, same layout. Square format.

### 1C: All Cyan (no orange)
Recreate this exact "DO DEALS WITH LEE" holographic gradient logo on black background with reflective floor. Keep everything the same EXCEPT make the entire logo cyan-to-white gradient — remove the orange entirely. House, text, tag all in shades of cyan/white holographic glow. Same layout. Square format.
