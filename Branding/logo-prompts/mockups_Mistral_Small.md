# Mockup Prompts from Mistral (Small)

Here are six detailed image prompts for your DDWL logo mockups:

1. **FOR SALE Sign**
   "Create a professional real estate yard sign mockup featuring the DDWL logo in a neon-style design. The logo should be centered on a black sign, with 'FOR SALE' in bold white letters above and a phone number below. The sign is placed on a green lawn in front of a modern Florida home. It's a sunny day with palm trees visible in the background. The DDWL logo should stand out with its cyan house, orange 'DO', and cyan 'DEALS' text, evoking a sense of trust and authority."

2. **Billboard**
   "Design a highway billboard mockup showcasing the DDWL logo prominently in the center on a black background. Below the logo, include the tagline '7,000+ Deals Closed' in white text. The billboard should be set against a blue sky with a visible highway below. The neon glow effect of the logo should make it pop even in daylight, conveying a sense of premium positioning and authority."

3. **Merch: Black T-Shirt**
   "Create a mockup of a premium black t-shirt laid flat, featuring the DDWL logo in a unique way. The cyan and orange neon colors of the logo should flow through the fabric like light streaks, starting from the logo and trailing down the shirt. The design should evoke a lifestyle brand feel, combining streetwear aesthetics with a professional touch."

4. **Merch: Snapback Hat**
   "Design a mockup of a black snapback hat with the DDWL logo embroidered on the front. The cyan and orange threads should catch the light, adding a subtle glow. The side panel of the hat should feature 'DDWL' in small cyan text. The hat should have a premium quality, blending streetwear and business aesthetics seamlessly."

5. **Merch: Black Polo**
   "Create a mockup of a professional black polo shirt with the DDWL logo embroidered small on the left chest. The polo should have a gold 'WITH LEE' tag visible, adding a touch of luxury. The design should be clean and executive, suitable for high-net-worth real estate investors. The logo should be subtle yet recognizable, conveying a sense of sophistication and premium positioning."

6. **Neon Sign**
   "Design a mockup of the DDWL logo as an actual neon sign mounted on a dark brick wall in a podcast studio. The neon sign should feature visible neon tubes and mounting brackets, with a warm glow illuminating the brick wall. The setting should be moody and professional, creating an Instagram-worthy atmosphere. The neon sign should evoke a sense of trust, authority, and premium positioning."
