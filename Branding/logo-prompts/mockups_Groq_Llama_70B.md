# Mockup Prompts from Groq (Llama 70B)

Here are the six detailed image prompts:

**1. FOR SALE Sign**
Generate a high-resolution image of a professional real estate yard sign on a lush green lawn in front of a modern Florida home. The sign features the DDWL logo in neon-style, with a cyan house, orange "DO", and cyan "DEALS" on a black background. The sign reads "FOR SALE" in bold white font above the logo, and a phone number is displayed below in smaller text. The scene is set on a sunny day with palm trees visible in the background. The image should convey a sense of luxury and high-end real estate. The sign should be the focal point, with the house and lawn blurred slightly in the background. Style: photorealistic, 2025-2026 design trends.

**2. Billboard**
Create a photorealistic image of a highway billboard featuring the DDWL logo prominently on a black background. The logo, with a cyan house, orange "DO", and cyan "DEALS", should be large and centered, with a neon glow effect that makes it pop even in daylight. Below the logo, the tagline "7,000+ Deals Closed" should be displayed in bold white font. The billboard should be set against a clear blue sky with a highway visible in the background, conveying a sense of movement and energy. The image should be high-contrast, with the black background and neon logo standing out against the bright sky. Style: modern, sophisticated minimalism.

**3. Merch: Black T-Shirt**
Generate an image of a premium black t-shirt laid flat, with the DDWL logo integrated into the fabric in a lifestyle brand style. The cyan and orange neon colors should flow through the fabric like light streaks, starting from the logo and trailing down the shirt. The effect should be as if the logo is illuminating the fabric from within. The image should be close-up, with the texture of the fabric visible. The background should be neutral, allowing the logo and fabric to take center stage. Style: high-fashion, 2025-2026 design trends, with a focus on sophisticated minimalism and jewel tones.

**4. Merch: Snapback Hat**
Create a high-resolution image of a black snapback hat with the DDWL logo embroidered on the front in cyan and orange threads. The embroidery should catch the light, giving the logo a premium, high-end feel. On the side panel, the text "DDWL" should be displayed in small cyan font. The image should be set against a neutral background, with the hat as the focal point. The style should be streetwear meets business, with a focus on premium quality and attention to detail. The image should convey a sense of luxury and sophistication.

**5. Merch: Black Polo**
Generate an image of a professional black polo shirt with the DDWL logo embroidered small on the left chest. The logo should be in cyan and orange threads, with a subtle sheen to the fabric. A small gold "WITH LEE" tag should be visible near the logo, adding a touch of elegance. The image should be set against a neutral background, with the polo shirt as the focal point. The style should be clean and executive, conveying a sense of high-end business and luxury. The image should be photorealistic, with a focus on texture and detail.

**6. Neon Sign**
Create a photorealistic image of the DDWL logo as an actual neon sign mounted on a dark brick wall in a podcast studio. The sign should feature visible neon tubes and mounting brackets, with a warm glow on the brick wall. The image should be set in a moody, atmospheric environment, with the sign as the focal point. The style should be modern and sophisticated, with a focus on high-contrast accents and jewel tones. The image should convey a sense of luxury and high-end design, with the neon sign adding a touch of nostalgia and glamour. The background should be blurred slightly, with the sign sharp and in focus.
