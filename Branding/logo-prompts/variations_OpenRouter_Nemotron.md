### **Variation 1: Classic Neon Glow**  
**Image Prompt:** A bold neon sign design featuring a cyan (#00E5FF) house icon with a glowing orange (#FF6B00) outline, "DO" in orange (#FF6B00), "DEALS" in cyan (#00E5FF), and "WITH LEE" in orange (#FF6B00). The text and icons have sharp, tubular neon outlines with a slight glow effect. The background is deep black (#0A0A0A) to enhance contrast. The scene includes a reflective floor beneath the logo, mimicking a real neon sign’s light reflection.  
**Color Breakdown:** DO=#FF6B00, House=#00E5FF, DEALS=#00E5FF, WITH LEE=#FF6B00, Background=#0A0A0A  
**Why It Works:** The high-contrast cyan and orange create a vibrant, energetic feel, perfect for neon signage. The orange "DO" and "WITH LEE" add warmth, while the cyan house reinforces trust. The reflective floor adds depth, making it visually dynamic.  
**Best Application:** Neon signs, outdoor signage, and digital ads where bold visibility is key.

The design includes a subtle gradient from orange to cyan in the "DEALS" text for movement.  
**Color Breakdown:** DO=#FF6B00, House=#FFD700, DEALS=#00E5FF, WITH LEE=#FFD700, Background=#0A0A0A
