# Logo Variations from Mistral (Small)

### **Neon Edge**
**Image Prompt:** Create a sleek, modern logo for a premium real estate brand. The design should feature the words "DO" in bold orange (#FF6B00) on the top left, followed by a house icon with a roofline and window in cyan (#00E5FF). Below the house, the word "DEALS" in large, bold cyan, and beneath that, a tagline "WITH LEE" in orange. The entire logo should have a true neon tube outline effect, glowing brightly against a black background. The neon should have a slight blur to simulate the glow of actual neon lighting. The design should be clean, minimalist, and highly scalable for use on everything from billboards to embroidered merchandise.

**Color Breakdown:** DO=[#FF6B00], House=[#00E5FF], DEALS=[#00E5FF], WITH LEE=[#FF6B00], Background=[#0A0A0A]
**Why It Works:** The neon edge effect creates a striking contrast that demands attention, perfect for both digital and physical applications. The warm/cool contrast between orange and cyan enhances readability and brand memorability.
