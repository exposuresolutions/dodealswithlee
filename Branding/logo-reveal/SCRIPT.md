## Audio Clips to Generate

### CLIP 1 — Intro (5 sec)
"What's up everybody, it's Lee Kearney — Do Deals With Lee."

### CLIP 2 — Setup (8 sec)
"We've been working on something big behind the scenes. A brand refresh that matches where we're headed in twenty twenty-six."

### CLIP 3 — Context (8 sec)
"We took the feedback from the team — Krystle wanted the house icon to pop in its own color, separate from the DO. And I wanted that neon energy we love."

### CLIP 4 — Reveal 1 (8 sec)
"First up — the Cyan House Neon. That electric blue house pops right off the screen. Gold DO, cyan everything else. Clean."

### CLIP 5 — Reveal 2 (8 sec)
"Number two — the Gold House Classic. This one's premium. Gold house, gold DO, that cyan glow on DEALS. This is the luxury play."

### CLIP 6 — Reveal 3 (8 sec)
"And number three — the Holographic. This one moves. Cyan to gold gradient across the text, orange house. It's got that future energy."

### CLIP 7 — Mockups (10 sec)
"But check this out — we didn't just make logos. We mocked up the neon sign for the podcast studio, the snapback hat, the black tee, even a for-sale sign on a property in Florida."

### CLIP 8 — Recommendation (10 sec)
"My pick? The Cyan House. That blue house with the gold DO — it reads from a hundred feet away, it works small on a business card, and it's going to look incredible as a neon sign."

### CLIP 9 — Outro (6 sec)
"Seven thousand deals and counting. New look, same hustle. Do Deals With Lee — let's go."
